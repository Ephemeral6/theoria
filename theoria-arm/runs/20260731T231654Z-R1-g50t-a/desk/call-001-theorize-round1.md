## prompt

```
You are the theorize desk of a world-modelling framework called
Theoria. You are playing an ARC-AGI-3 game you have never seen, through a
64x64 grid of colour codes, by maintaining an explicit written theory of it.

Your job is NOT to pick a good move. Your job is to write two books, and the
books are the only thing that predicts anything:

  theory.dsl   -- the manual: what this world IS. Vocabulary, rules, winning
                  condition, laws. It compiles to an executable predictor, and
                  that predictor is the whole system's only predictor. If it is
                  wrong, everything downstream is wrong; there is no side door.
  playbook.dsl -- the playbook: how to WIN. Ordering, pruning, heuristics,
                  decomposition. Never a stored solution.

Six rules bind you, and they are not style advice:

1. ONLY you write these two books. Search engines put proposals in a candidate
   box; every one of them is a proposal, not a fact. You accept, reject, or
   carry it as pending, and you say why.
2. NO ENTRY WITHOUT EVIDENCE. Every rule carries the transitions that witness
   it and its coverage. A rule you believe but cannot witness does not go in
   the manual -- it goes in `laws:` as a `theorem ... [probe: pending]`, which
   is a promise to test it, not a claim that it holds.
3. NO ENTRY WITHOUT GAIN. A concept earns its place by making the manual
   shorter than writing out the pixels it explains. When a concept fails this
   test but is still needed (because some pixel would otherwise be
   unexplained), admit it AND SAY SO -- that conflict is worth more than a
   tidy manual.
4. FULL-FRAME RESPONSIBILITY. Every pixel of every frame belongs either to the
   board (cells that never vary) or to some object you declared. A pixel your
   manual cannot draw is a defect in the manual, and it will be caught: your
   manual is re-drawn onto every observed frame and compared cell by cell.
5. TRANSITIONS ARE UNAMBIGUOUS. For any state and action, exactly one
   successor. Two rules that can both fire on the same object in the same
   transition is an error, not a preference.
6. WHAT YOU DO NOT KNOW, YOU SAY. This world has been observed for a few dozen
   actions. The honest manual is small, and names its own gaps. A manual that
   over-claims will be refuted by the very next frame and cost a whole round
   to repair; a manual that under-claims just stays small.

You will be given: what has been observed, the current frame, the diff of every
command, and what the engines proposed. If a manual and a playbook already
exist you will be given those too, together with the surprises that brought you
back here -- those surprises are the reason you are being paid, and each one
must be answered by a change or by an explicit refusal to change.



# theory.dsl -- the exact grammar the compiler accepts

Sections, each introduced by a bare `<name>:` line, bodies INDENTED by at least
one space. Order is free. `#` starts a comment on its own line.

## semantics:  (MANDATORY -- a manual without it does not parse)
    frame persist            # the only value the Python backend compiles
    conflict exclusive       # the only value the Python backend compiles
    cascade single_frame     # the only value the Python backend compiles

## word_table:
    board                                   # declares the never-varying cells
    object Cart { pos: Coord, color: Int }  # arc-colour: 6
    object Door { pos: Coord, color: Int, present: Bool }  # arc-colour: 5
    landmark exit_cell                      # arc-cell: (7, 3)
    domain dir { up, down, left, right }    # a value domain, for `forall`
    Cart [segment: uniform_color ev: t0-t12 compress: 2125]   # the concept account

  Field types in use: `pos: Coord`, `color: Int`, `present: Bool`, `alive: Bool`.
  Only pos/alive/present/color are observations the compiler reasons over.
  `pos: Coord` is what makes this a GRID world (directions up/down/left/right).

  EVERY `landmark` line MUST carry a trailing `# arc-cell: (row, col)` comment.
  A landmark is level data, so the manual names it and the level places it —
  and there is nowhere in the DSL to write coordinates, which is the point of
  the split. A landmark the level cannot place is a HARD compile error, so a
  landmark you declare without this comment lands at (0,0) and takes your rule
  with it.

  EVERY `object` line MUST carry a trailing `# arc-colour: <n>` comment naming
  the hex colour code that object shows in the frame. That comment is not
  decoration: the level instance is COMPUTED from the frames, and the colour is
  how the arm finds your object in the grid. An object without it is located
  nowhere, is drawn at (0,0), and the responsibility check will report every
  one of its pixels as unexplained.

### OBJECTS WITH EXTENT — read this before declaring anything
An instance is drawn as EXACTLY ONE CELL. A 3x3 token or a 24-pixel ring is
therefore not one instance, however you declare it, and if you declare it as
one then every other cell of it is an unexplained pixel forever.

Add `arc-instances: all` and the arm creates ONE INSTANCE PER CELL, all of the
same declared type, covering every cell of that colour the board cannot explain:

    object Ring  { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 9  arc-instances: all
    object Token { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 1  arc-instances: all
    object Pip   { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 3

`Pip` has no `arc-instances`, so it is a single cell — correct for a genuine
one-pixel marker, wrong for anything else.

Consequences you must design for:

* **There is no instance called `Ring`.** There are `Ring_r8c14`,
  `Ring_r8c15`, … A rule that names `Ring` will not compile. Write rules over
  the TYPE instead:

        rule shift forall ?p in Ring [ev: t2 cov: 1/1]
          when act=key(2) and free(below(?p)) then moved(?p, down)

  `forall ?p in <ObjectType>` grounds the rule once per instance.
* **Every cell that ever changed needs an owner**, or it is unexplained. Count
  them: the evidence brief gives you `dynamic_cells`. If your declarations
  cannot cover them all, say which are left over and why, in a `theorem`.
* Two objects of the SAME colour still cannot be told apart by this arm — it
  looks objects up by colour and nothing else. Declare one type covering both
  and carry the belief that they are distinct as a `theorem`.

## events:
    event moved(o, dir) | jumped(o, dest) | recolored(o, c) | vanished(o)

  Documentation only -- the backend dispatches on a fixed table, listed below.

## rules:
    rule push_up [ev: t6,t16 cov: 52/52]
      when act=key(1) and free(above(Cart)) then moved(Cart, up)

    rule slide forall ?d in dir [ev: t3 cov: 4/4]
      when act=key(1) and free(toward(Cart, ?d)) then moved(Cart, ?d)

  * the header line ends at `]` -- NO trailing comment on it, and none on the
    `when ... then ...` line either. Both are parse errors.
  * `forall ?v in <domain>` grounds to `<rule>_<value>` rules.
  * every rule carries `[ev: ... cov: k/n]`. Constraint 5: no entry without
    evidence.

### guards -- EXHAUSTIVE. Anything else fails to compile.
    act=<name>(<arg>, ...)      args are bare names or integer literals only
    free(<cell>)                cell renders as the background colour
    colored(<cell>, 7)          second argument must be an INTEGER LITERAL
    adjacent(<cell>, <cell>)
    <value> = <value>           also != < > <= >=  (SPACES around the operator)
    <cell> = wall               tests off-board
  joined by `and`. Use `not` before an atom for negation.

### cells -- EXHAUSTIVE.
    Cart                    an instance name means that instance's position
    exit_cell               a declared landmark
    above(x) below(x) leftof(x) rightof(x)      NOTE: leftof/rightof
    toward(x, ?d)           toward(x, <direction>)
    pos(<value>)

### values
    integer literals; true; false; a landmark name; a direction name;
    an instance name; `Cart.color`; `+` and `-` only (no `*`, no `/`);
    tuple literals like `(3, 7)`.

### events a rule may fire -- EXHAUSTIVE, dispatched on (name, arity).
    moved(o, <dir>)                 o moves one cell
    jumped(o, <landmark>)           o goes to a named cell
    teleported(o, <landmark>)       same shape
    jumped(o, <over-object>, <dir>) o travels two cells; <over> gets alive=False
    recolored(o, <int literal>)
    vanished(o)      -> present=False
    appeared(o)      -> present=True
    removed(o)       -> alive=False
  The first argument is always a bare object name. A bare coordinate as a
  destination is REFUSED -- declare a landmark.

## goal:
    goal Cart.pos = exit_cell
    goal count(Door) = 0
    goal count(Button, color = 8) = 2

  `=` only. `>=`/`<=`/`>`/`<` do not compile. No goal section at all is legal
  and compiles to `is_goal -> False`.

## laws:
    invariant cart_unique count(Cart) = 1 [status: proven]
    theorem exit_needs_key "prose, in the manual's own words"
      [depends: push_up, unlock  probe: pending]

  THE TWO ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE AND THIS IS THE EASIEST MISTAKE TO MAKE:

    `invariant <name> <expr> <op> <value> [status: ...]`
        The body MUST contain one of  =  !=  <  >  <=  >=  . It is an
        equation, not a sentence. `invariant foo "in words ..."` is a parse
        error: "No comparison op in invariant".

    `theorem <name> "<prose>" [depends: ... probe: pending|passed]`
        The body MUST be a quoted sentence. This is where a belief you cannot
        write as an equation goes -- and most of what you want to say after
        six transitions belongs here, not in `invariant`.

  Invariant bodies are stored as RAW TEXT and are not checked by any backend
  (the sole exception is the `pagoda(w)` form, which needs a LINE world and an
  LP certificate and does not apply here). Declaring one is a claim you are
  making, not a claim the compiler will verify -- say so honestly in `status:`.

# playbook.dsl -- four statement forms and nothing else
    order    keys_before_doors            [proof: lean]
    prune    boxed_in and not goal => dead [proof: lean]
    heuristic w_distance                  [admissible: lean]
    prefer   try_unvisited_first          [ev: 3/4 levels]

  Constraint 10: NO literal solutions. A parser heuristic rejects any line that
  looks like a stored action sequence, and any unrecognised line is a hard
  error.

# THE ACTION VOCABULARY FOR THIS WORLD
This game's actions are ARC's ACTION1..ACTION7. Write them as `act=key(<n>)`
and nothing else -- the arm maps ACTION<n> to the tuple ('key', <n>) in both
directions. A click action carries coordinates the guard language cannot
express; if you need one, say so in a `theorem ... [probe: pending]` instead of
inventing syntax.

## Every command, and what changed

`t` indexes the state sequence. `frames` is how many grids one command returned -- more than one means the world took several internal steps for a single action.

- t0   RESET     frames=1   state=NOT_FINISHED (first frame)
- t1   ACTION1   frames=1   state=NOT_FINISHED no cells changed
- t2   ACTION2   frames=7   state=NOT_FINISHED 49 cells changed, rows 8-63, cols 14-63, [5, 9] -> [1, 5, 9]
- t3   ACTION3   frames=1   state=NOT_FINISHED no cells changed
- t4   ACTION4   frames=1   state=NOT_FINISHED (63,62) 9->1
- t5   ACTION5   frames=9   state=NOT_FINISHED 71 cells changed, rows 1-18, cols 1-18, [0, 1, 5, 9] -> [0, 2, 5, 9]

## What the engines proposed

These are PROPOSALS. Nothing here is accepted until you accept it, and an engine cannot name anything -- `obj0` is the best it can do.

## The manual as it stands

```
# theory.dsl -- world observed for 34 states / 33 transitions
# (RESET + A1 A2 A3 A4 A5, then A2 A5 twelve times, then A5 A5 A5 A5).
# 87 cells have ever changed; this manual names and owns all 87.
#
# WHAT THIS ROUND COST AND WHAT IT BOUGHT
#
#   Last round I deleted `colored(spawn_probe, 5)` from thirteen panel rules
#   on a gain-test argument, and said in as many words: my manual now
#   predicts key(5) at spawn toggles 23 panel cells, no frame has ever
#   tested that, if it is wrong I pay 23 pixels and learn something worth
#   more than 23 pixels. THE WORLD ANSWERED. Four commands, all ACTION5,
#   all at spawn, indices 30-33. The panel did not move. Not one panel
#   pixel changed in four presses. THE CUT WAS WRONG AND IT IS REVERSED:
#   the guard is restored on all thirteen rules, and it now has what it
#   never had before -- FOUR NEGATIVE WITNESSES. 13 toggles with the body
#   away, 0 toggles with the body home. The atom is earned.
#
#   THE SAME FOUR COMMANDS SETTLED THE OTHER OPEN QUESTION, and settled it
#   the other way. Row 63 now reads 9 through col 47 and 1 from col 48:
#   SIXTEEN burns, two more than at state 29. Four presses of an ODD key,
#   at indices 30, 31, 32, 33, burned exactly twice -- at 30 and at 32.
#   Reading A (burns iff the key is 2 or 4) predicted ZERO burns and is
#   DEAD. Reading B (burns iff the command index is even) predicted exactly
#   two, in exactly those places, and is now 33/33 with a discriminating
#   set. The meter is a command counter and no key touches it.
#
#   AND THE FOUR COMMANDS PROVED THE THING I HAVE CARRIED AS A BELIEF SINCE
#   STATE 5. s30 and s31 are pixel-identical (distinct_states 30 against 34
#   states = four coincidences: s1=s0, s3=s2, s31=s30, s33=s32). From s30
#   the world was given ACTION5 and returned s31 = s30, identity. From s31,
#   the same pixels, the world was given ACTION5 AGAIN and returned s32,
#   one pixel burned. SAME STATE, SAME ACTION, DIFFERENT SUCCESSOR. This
#   world is NOT a function of the drawn frame, and constraint 5 obliges my
#   manual to be one. See the_world_is_not_a_function_of_the_drawn_frame.
#
#   THE BILL, STATED PLAINLY: replay can no longer be perfect. t31 and t33
#   replay exactly (identity). t30 and t32 each miss by ONE pixel, the
#   parity burn, which no guard in this language can express and which was
#   board at the instant it burned. Expect 31/33. That is the floor, not a
#   defect I can repair, and I would rather post it than hide it behind an
#   action-keyed burn rule that is now known to be a mis-attribution.

  theorem the_cut_is_reversed_and_the_guard_is_now_earned "THE ROUND'S FIRST STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND IT IS AN UNDO OF MINE. Last round I deleted colored(spawn_probe, 5) from thirteen panel rules, on the argument that its thirteen positive witnesses were confounded -- every ACTION5 in history had followed an ACTION2, so `key(5) was pressed` and `the body is away` were the same thirteen events, and constraint 3 says a conjunct with no discriminating negative explains no pixel. THE ARGUMENT WAS SOUND AND THE CONCLUSION WAS FALSE, and the difference between those two sentences is the whole value of this round. The manual then predicted 23 panel cells for key(5) at spawn; the world was asked four times and answered zero panel cells four times. THE ATOM NOW HAS FOUR NEGATIVE WITNESSES -- t30, t31, t32, t33, all ACTION5, all with the body home at spawn, all with the panel unmoved in configuration B, confirmed cell by cell in the current frame which still reads 222/2.2/222 at cols 1-3 and 999/9.9/999 at cols 5-7 with row 5 dark at 1-3 and lit at 5-7. So the guard is restored on all thirteen rules and it is no longer a correlation: 13/13 toggles with the body away, 0/4 with the body home. WHAT I WOULD DO AGAIN: buy a negative witness by removing an unearned guard, because an unwitnessed silence is invisible and an unwitnessed prediction of change is answered in one press. WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY: the answer arrived on the FIRST press and the next three bought nothing new about the panel -- they were paid for by the meter, which is the only reason this round was not a waste."

  theorem the_meter_is_command_parity_and_no_key_touches_it "SETTLED, and settled against the reading my rules encode. Row 63 is a 64-cell colour-9 bar burning 9 to 1 one cell at a time from the right; the current frame reads 9 through col 47 and 1 from col 48 to col 63, SIXTEEN burns after thirty-three commands. Burns occurred at command indices 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32 -- every even index, sixteen of them, no odd index ever. READING A said burns iff the key is 2 or 4. READING B said burns iff the index is even. For twenty-nine commands the two were numerically identical because every command was an even key at an even index or an odd key at an odd index; I said the separator was one odd key at an even index and cost one command. THIS ROUND SPENT FOUR ODD KEYS AT INDICES 30-33 AND READING A PREDICTED ZERO BURNS. Two burns happened, at 30 and 32, exactly where B says. READING A IS DEAD. The meter counts commands, not keys, and it does not care which key. CONSEQUENCE FOR MY THREE BURN RULES: their attribution is now KNOWN FALSE. I keep them anyway and say why -- they are the shortest expressible shadow of the true law, they draw 14 of the 16 burns on replay, and every alternative is worse. A key(5) burn rule would fire at t31 and t33 where nothing burned; an action-free burn rule would fire at every odd index from t5 on and lose seventeen transitions. Fourteen right, two structurally unreachable, and no better option inside this grammar."

  theorem the_world_is_not_a_function_of_the_drawn_frame "PROVEN THIS ROUND, after carrying it as a belief since state 5. The proof needs two pixel-identical states from which the SAME action produced different successors, and the store hands me the pair: distinct_states is 30 against 34 states, so there are exactly four coincidences, and they are s1=s0, s3=s2, s31=s30, s33=s32. The first two are the old sterile pair -- different keys were pressed from each, so they test nothing. THE LAST TWO ARE NOT. Refutations P-25 and P-26 report the SAME observed hash 132f0bf441d96376, and P-27 and P-28 the same 121cbbc9c93803ed: so s31 = s30 and s33 = s32 to the pixel. Now read the transitions. t31 acted on s30 with ACTION5 and returned s31, which equals s30 -- identity. t32 acted on s31, THE SAME PIXELS, with ACTION5 AGAIN, and returned s32, which differs by one burned bar cell. Same state, same action, two different successors. The hidden bit is the command counter the meter reads and no guard in this language can. WHAT IT COSTS ME IS EXACT AND UNAVOIDABLE: constraint 5 obliges my manual to be a function of the frame, so my manual must be wrong about at least one member of every such pair, and it is wrong about t30 and t32 by exactly one pixel each.

The world's successors were change, no-change, change, no-change, and the changes are one pixel each at indices 30 and 32. THREE THINGS FELL OUT OF FOUR COMMANDS: the panel guard is earned (four negatives), the meter is command parity (reading A refuted), and the world is not a function of the frame (a pixel-identical pair with the same key and different successors). Compare the six rounds before it: twenty-four refutations, every divergence set a subset of the meter's leading edge, ZERO rules contradicted, nothing learned. A prediction the world can answer is worth more than a prediction that is safe, and this is the evidence for that claim rather than the slogan."

This round pressed it FOUR TIMES AT SPAWN and the body did not move a pixel. UP predicts exactly that -- north of spawn is void, the move is blocked. RETURN predicts exactly that -- the body is already home. UNDO in its plain form is REFUTED: t29 was an effective ACTION5 that carried the body home, so an undo at t30 would have carried it back south, and it did not. UNDO survives only in a stack variant where no-ops are not pushed and t29 emptied the stack; I record that variant rather than pretend it is dead, but I no longer rank it. THE SEPARATOR IS NOW CHEAP AND NAMED: press ACTION5 from any cell that is neither spawn nor one south with open floor above it. From lattice (1,3), one step east, UP is void so UP predicts nothing while RETURN predicts a 48-pixel jump west to spawn. That is one more reason the east key is the next thing to buy.

Every one of the thirteen positives had the body at ONE specific cell, lattice (2,2), and every one of the four negatives had it at spawn. So a guard reading `the body is at (2,2)` -- a second landmark at (14,14) tested for colour 9 -- fits the same 13 positives and the same 4 negatives EXACTLY as well. The two guards differ only at cells the body has never occupied: from a third cell, spawn_probe says the panel toggles and a south_probe would say it does not. I choose spawn_probe because it is the guard that already replayed twenty-five transitions and because the panel reads as a counter of effective ACTION5s rather than of one location, but I am naming the confound BEFORE it costs me, unlike last round.

SECOND: the true meter law is `burns iff the command index is even`, and the guard language reads pixels and the action name and nothing else. There is no command counter, no phase pixel, and the frame provably does not determine the parity, since s30 and s31 are identical and only one of them was followed by a burn.

The socket interior has never changed, so it is board and count() has nothing to range over there, and the pip (52,46) will never become dynamic because the body's aperture leaves it rendering 9. The 24 ring cells of lattice (8,7) do become dynamic on first entry, but they are frame-0 colour 5 and would type as Vacated -- indistinguishable by this arm from the 24 Vacated cells at rows 14-18 -- so count(Vacated, color = 9) = 24 would be true of the body standing one cell south of spawn, which is not a win. The alternatives fail too: count(Glyph9, color = 5) = 24 is true of every state where the body is anywhere but home, and a Wire type on colour 8 would have zero instances because every colour-8 cell is constant, so count(Wire) = 0 would be true at RESET. A goal true in the wrong states is worse than no goal, because it stops a planner at its first step. I name the price plainly: is_goal compiles to False, no plan terminates, and nothing ranks one command above another except whether the command is predicted to change pixels -- which, with the guard restored, admits exactly ONE key at spawn again, and that key is the one that has been pressed thirteen times."

The body is at spawn, the panel is in configuration B, sixteen meter cells are burned. ACTION3 at spawn: my manual predicts ZERO cells and has NO WITNESS for that, so this is the press I want -- 48 undrawable cells plus the burn means ACTION3 IS EAST and the map is closed; 1 cell, the burn alone, means ACTION3 is not east and therefore ACTION4 IS EAST by elimination, since ACTION1 and ACTION5 are both excluded from east at this very cell. Either answer names the east key. ACTION4 at spawn: the same experiment with the labels swapped. ACTION1 at spawn: 1 cell, key1_inert_at_spawn firing as a no-op, the silence I already have a witness for, nothing bought. ACTION5 at spawn: 1 cell, now WITNESSED four times, nothing bought. ACTION2 at spawn: 48 body cells I draw correctly plus the burn -- one wrong pixel and nothing learned, because key2_body_leaves and key2_body_arrives are at 312/312, except for one free datum, the cascade must be NINE frames from configuration B.

Thirteen panel rules once carried colored(spawn_probe, 5) while the landmark line read a prose placeholder instead of a coordinate; the grammar puts such a landmark at (0,0), (0,0) is background in every frame this world has drawn, and so all thirteen rules were unreachable text that fired never and clashed never. Responsibility passed, ambiguity passed, step crashed zero times, and ONLY replay caught it. The coda, now complete: that same atom was deleted last round for failing the gain test and is restored this round with four negative witnesses. It has been wrong by pointing nowhere, wrong by being absent, and is now right for a reason I can state. The landmark reads (8, 14), the top-left pixel of the spawn ring, which renders 9 while the body is home and 5 the moment it is anywhere else.

  theorem i_cannot_manufacture_an_instance_on_a_cell_that_has_never_changed "Recorded because a future desk will be tempted by the same repair I have now rejected five times. To draw the leading-edge burn I would need an instance on a board cell. The arm offers exactly one lever, arc-instances: all, and its documented behaviour is to instance every cell OF THAT COLOUR THE BOARD CANNOT EXPLAIN -- a never-varying cell is precisely what the board explains, so it gets no instance. The tempting workaround is a second declared type on colour 9 without arc-instances, hoping the arm seats one instance somewhere useful. I reject it: the arm looks objects up by colour and nothing else, so a second colour-9 type is indistinguishable from Glyph9, the seat is unspecified, and any cell it landed on would be claimed twice, which is the constraint-5 error the grammar warns about in as many words. A landmark cannot help either, because landmarks are cells and every event in the language takes an object as its first argument. So the hole is a property of the arm, it is permanent for this level, and with parity confirmed it now costs one pixel on EVERY second command rather than only on key 2 and key 4."

Its eighteen tracks corroborate the panel by frame index and one of them corroborates THIS ROUND specifically: obj17, colour 2, first_frame 29, frames_present 5 -- the only colour-2 track longer than two frames, which is the panel standing still through t30-t33 exactly as the restored guard requires. obj0 and obj2 persisting through all 34 frames while the segmenter narrates 26 moves is the marker-with-two-seats reading. obj4 is the whole 64-cell bar of which 16 cells are now dynamic. obj3 is a 1006-cell colour-null blob that swallowed the maze floor AND the body ring: connected_components(4) cannot see the mover at all, because the mover is a ring of floor-adjacent pixels that merges with the floor, and THAT ABSENCE IS THE FINDING. None of these gets a type of its own; a second type on the same pixels invites the double claim rule 5 forbids. zero_space self-reports THIN in its own words -- 33 transitions constrain rank 17 of 435 features, null space dimension 418, nearly every vector in it a law true over these states and unfalsified rather than confirmed -- and its single global law is my census. cegis_miner refuses on every track and its verdict, `the world does not narrate as one mover`, remains true of the arm and false of the world: there is one mover, a rigid 24-pixel ring, and the arm can only see 24 simultaneous recolours."

## The playbook as it stands

```
# playbook.dsl -- what to buy with the next command, not a route.
#
# ========= WHAT THE LAST FOUR COMMANDS SETTLED =========
# Four presses of ACTION5 at spawn, indices 30-33. The panel did not move.
# Two bar cells burned, at indices 30 and 32.
#
#   1. THE CUT IS REVERSED. `colored(spawn_probe, 5)` is back on thirteen
#      panel rules and it now has FOUR NEGATIVE WITNESSES: 13/13 toggles
#      with the body away, 0/4 with the body home. ACTION5 at spawn is a
#      witnessed no-op.
#   2. THE METER IS COMMAND PARITY. Four ODD keys at indices 30-33 burned
#      exactly twice, at the two EVEN indices. The action-keyed reading
#      predicted zero burns and is dead. 33/33 for parity, with a
#      discriminating set at last. No key touches the meter.
#   3. THE WORLD IS NOT A FUNCTION OF THE DRAWN FRAME -- PROVEN. s30 and
#      s31 are pixel-identical; ACTION5 from s30 returned identity and
#      ACTION5 from s31 burned a cell. Same pixels, same key, two
#      successors.
#
# The wrong prediction was worth more than six safe rounds. But only the
# FIRST of the four presses answered it; presses two, three and four were
# the harness re-choosing the same key against a rolled-forward frame, and
# they were paid for by the meter alone. Buying a negative witness is right;
# buying it four times is not.
#
# ========= THE BOARD AS THE MANUAL NOW SEES IT =========
#   At spawn (where the body IS):  key(2) -> 48 body cells
#                                  keys 1, 5 -> nothing, WITNESSED
#                                  keys 3, 4 -> nothing, NO WITNESS
#   Index 34 is EVEN, so (63,47) burns under every key and I cannot draw it:
#   one guaranteed wrong pixel this turn whatever is pressed, and
#   refutation-fired carries ZERO information at an even index.
#
# ========= THE ONE THING WORTH BUYING =========
# EAST IS ACTION3 OR ACTION4 AND ONE PRESS SETTLES IT.
#   ACTION2 is down (13/13). ACTION1 is not east -- pressed at spawn at t1
#   with east open, nothing moved. ACTION5 is not east -- pressed at spawn
#   four times this round with east open, nothing moved. Two candidates
#   remain and the body is standing where the test is free: east of spawn is
#   three lattice cells of unbroken floor, west is void.
#   Press ACTION3 (or ACTION4): if the body steps, that key is EAST and the
#   map is closed; if it does not, the OTHER is east by elimination. Both
#   outcomes name the east key. No other command on the board names anything.
#
# The advertised price of the step onto fresh ground: 48 pixels my manual
# cannot draw, because rows 8-12 cols 20-24 have never changed and are board.
# That is a refutation I have priced in advance and it must not be read as a
# defect. 24 pixels for the second step, 0 for the third.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# STATE 33: body home at lattice (1,2); panel configuration B; SIXTEEN meter
# cells burned, cols 48-63 of row 63; next command index 34, EVEN. Eleven
# lattice cells reachable, the body has stood in TWO in thirty-four states.
# Three steps east along lattice row 1 reach the cell beside the knob; the
# knob is the far end of one connected colour-8 wire whose near end is the
# comb; the comb gates every route to the socket at (8,7). Under parity the
# bar buys about 96 more commands against a route of about nineteen steps:
# the budget is not binding, repetition is.

# theory.dsl -- world observed for 6 states / 5 transitions
# (RESET, then ACTION1 ACTION2 ACTION3 ACTION4 ACTION5, indices t1..t5).
# 73 cells have ever changed; this manual names and owns all 73.
#
# WHY THIS ROUND EXISTS AND WHAT IT REPAIRS
#
#   The only surprise that fired is replay_mismatch with the reason
#   "theory.dsl is non-empty but generated/theory.py could not be loaded".
#   certify returned an EMPTY replay dict, an EMPTY responsibility dict and
#   unambiguous: null. Nothing ran. That is not a wrong manual, it is a
#   manual that does not compile, and there is exactly one line in the
#   previous text that the grammar calls a HARD compile error:
#
#       landmark spawn_probe  # arc-cell: carried, coordinates stripped
#
#   The spec is explicit: every landmark line MUST carry a trailing
#   # arc-cell: (row, col) comment, and a landmark the level cannot place
#   is a hard compile error. The previous manual even contained a theorem
#   named a_landmark_is_only_as_true_as_the_comment_beside_it which SAYS
#   the landmark reads (8, 14) -- while the landmark line itself said
#   prose. The prose was carried forward and the coordinate was not.
#   FIXED: the line now reads # arc-cell: (8, 14). Second parse risk
#   removed: the empty `goal:` section is gone entirely, since a manual
#   with no goal section at all is legal and an empty one is a guess.
#
#   THE OBSERVATION RECORD HAS BEEN ROLLED BACK AND I HAVE REWRITTEN THE
#   WHOLE MANUAL TO IT. The store now reports 6 states, 5 transitions, 73
#   dynamic cells, 4023 constant cells, 2 burned meter cells. The previous
#   manual was written against 34 states, 87 dynamic cells, 16 burned meter
#   cells. 87 - 73 = 14 and 16 - 2 = 14: this record is a strict PREFIX of
#   that history, cut at state 5. So every `ev:` and every `cov:` in the
#   old text cited transitions this desk cannot see. All of them are
#   rewritten to what the record actually contains, and every rule whose
#   only witnesses lay past t5 has been REMOVED from rules: and parked in
#   laws: with its text intact. See the_record_is_a_prefix and
#   the_rules_i_have_no_witness_for_in_this_record.
#
#   WHAT THAT BUYS: this manual should replay 5/5 exactly. t1 and t3 are
#   no-ops it draws as no-ops, t2 is 49 cells it draws as 49, t4 is 1 cell
#   it draws as 1, t5 is 71 cells it draws as 71. There is no priced-in
#   miss anywhere in this record. The old manual advertised 31/33; this one
#   advertises 5/5 and will be caught out at once if that is wrong.

Second parse hazard removed at the same time: the previous manual carried a `goal:` header with an empty body, and the spec sanctions NO goal section rather than an empty one. THE LESSON THAT GENERALISES: a compile failure is invisible to every other check in this rig. Responsibility, ambiguity and step-crash counts all reported cleanly in earlier rounds while thirteen rules pointed at (0,0); this time not even those ran. Before believing any certify number, check that certify had something to run."

The manual I inherited was written against 34 states, 87 dynamic cells and 16 burned meter cells. The difference is 14 in both places, which is exactly the number of extra meter cells that had burned, so THIS RECORD IS A STRICT PREFIX OF THAT HISTORY, cut at state 5, and the current frame is that history's state 5. I have rewritten every ev: and every cov: to the transitions I can actually see, and I have deleted from rules: every rule whose only witnesses lay past t5. WHAT I AM GIVING UP AND SAYING SO: the inherited text reports things I now cannot re-derive -- thirteen descents, thirteen panel toggles, four presses of ACTION5 at spawn that witnessed its silence, and a discriminating experiment at indices 30 to 33 that killed the action-keyed reading of the meter. I do not treat my own prior prose as evidence in a book whose first rule is that every entry carries the transitions that witness it. I carry those claims as named beliefs below, flagged as unwitnessed HERE, and I let this record decide them again. Where the prefix and the prior text disagree about what to write, the prefix wins."

(1) THE PANEL TOGGLING BACK, five rules: key5_slot1_lights over Glyph9 when act=key(5) and colored(spawn_probe, 5) and colored(?p, 2) then recolored(?p, 9); key5_underline1_lights over Glyph9 with colored(?p, 0) and above-six equals wall then recolored(?p, 9); key5_slot2_ring_resets over Spent with colored(?s, 9) then recolored(?s, 1); key5_slot2_centre_resets over Spent with colored(?s, 0) then recolored(?s, 1); key5_underline2_dims over Dark with colored(?d, 9) then recolored(?d, 0).

The burns were at t2 (ACTION2) and t4 (ACTION4) and at no other index. READING A: the bar burns iff the key is 2 or 4. READING B: the bar burns iff the command index is even. Over t1 to t5 the two are numerically IDENTICAL -- every even index carried an even key -- so this record cannot tell them apart, and I say that rather than pretend my rules settle it. My two burn rules encode reading A, for the only reason available inside this grammar: reading B cannot be written here at all, because the guard language reads pixels and the action name and there is no command counter. THE SEPARATOR IS FREE AND IT IS THE NEXT COMMAND. The next index is 6, EVEN. An ODD key at an even index splits them: reading A predicts no burn, reading B predicts (63,61) goes to 1. ACTION3 and ACTION4 are the two keys I want to press anyway for the direction question, and ACTION3 is odd, so ONE PRESS OF ACTION3 BUYS BOTH ANSWERS. The inherited text says this experiment was run at indices 30 to 33 and reading B won; I do not hold that as evidence, but I do note that if reading B is right my burn rules are a mis-attribution that happens to draw every burn in this record, and I would keep them anyway as the shortest expressible shadow of the true law."

SO NEITHER ACTION3 NOR ACTION4 IS UP OR DOWN, and if either is a direction key at all it is HORIZONTAL. That is the sharpest thing this record says: the east key, if it exists, is ACTION3 or ACTION4, and one press from spawn -- where east is three lattice cells of unbroken floor -- names it whichever way it answers. ACTION5 is up, or return-to-start, or undo; all three agree on the only press ever made.

The inherited text records that exact deletion being made, being answered by four presses of ACTION5 at spawn with the panel unmoved, and being reversed. I cannot cite those four presses. I can note that the cheap version of the same experiment is available: press ACTION5 at spawn once. Panel still means the guard is earned; panel moves means eight rules are guarded on the wrong thing. A second confound is worth naming before it costs me: the single positive had the body at ONE cell, (2,2), so a guard reading `the body is at (2,2)` fits identically and differs only at a third lattice cell the body has never occupied."

That gap is consistent with the arm treating background-coloured cells as board-explained and refusing to instance them. If so, `object Dark ... arc-colour: 0 arc-instances: all` yields ZERO instances, key5_underline2_lights grounds on nothing, and three pixels of t5 come back unexplained in the responsibility report. I declare Dark anyway, because the alternative is to leave three pixels of an observed change with no owner at all, and because a responsibility report naming those three cells tells me the arm's rule in one round. If they come back unexplained the repair is not another type on colour 0 -- two types on one colour are indistinguishable to an arm that looks objects up by colour and nothing else -- it is to accept the three cells as board and delete the rule."

A cell that has never changed is board, no object owns it, and NO RULE CAN DRAW ITS FIRST CHANGE. This prices the first eastward step exactly. Lattice (1,3) is rows 8-12 cols 20-24; not one of those 25 cells has ever changed, so 24 arrival pixels are undrawable NO MATTER WHAT RULE I WRITE. The 24 departure pixels at the spawn ring are instances, but no east-leaves rule exists and none can be written before an east press witnesses one. So the first step east costs 48 wrong pixels, plus one more at (63,61) if the meter turns out to be command parity. THE SECOND step east costs 24, the third costs 0. I state this now so that a refutation whose divergence set is exactly rows 8-12 cols 20-24 is read as the advertised price of new ground and not as a defect in the rules. One further consequence worth knowing before it confuses someone: THE BODY CHANGES TYPE AS IT WALKS. Typing is by frame-0 colour, the body was colour 9 at rows 8-12 and floor was colour 5 everywhere else, so the same physical mover is Glyph9 at spawn and Vacated one cell south."

The tempting workaround is a second declared type on colour 9 without arc-instances, hoping the arm seats one instance somewhere useful; I reject it, because the arm looks objects up by colour and nothing else, so a second colour-9 type is indistinguishable from Glyph9, its seat is unspecified, and any cell it landed on would be claimed twice -- the rule-5 error the grammar warns about in as many words.

Eight panel rules rest on this and every row and column discrimination in the panel is built from it. The k-th above is off-board exactly when k exceeds the row: row 1 is above-twice equals wall; row 3 is a colour test on above-twice, false for row 1 precisely because a colour test on an off-board cell is false; row 2 is above-three equals wall conjoined with a colour test on above-once. The same trick separates slot 2's middle row BY COLUMN: col 5 is leftof-six equals wall; col 6 is leftof-seven equals wall with a colour test on leftof-once; col 7 is a colour test on leftof-twice. The three are pairwise exclusive, which is why no ambiguity clash has ever been reported on them. Not one rule in this manual uses `not`, deliberately.

None of these gets a type of its own; a second type on the same pixels invites the double claim rule 5 forbids. cegis_miner refuses on every track -- four refusals naming recolor and vanish narrations and one absent object -- and its verdict, the world does not narrate as one mover, is true of the arm and false of the world: there is one mover, a rigid 24-pixel ring, and the arm can only see 24 simultaneous recolours. zero_space self-reports THIN in its own words -- 5 transitions constrain rank 3 of 365 features, null space dimension 362, nearly every vector in it a law true over these states and unfalsified rather than confirmed -- and its single global law enumerates exactly my 73 dynamic cells, which is the census and nothing more."

  theorem what_i_predict_before_i_see_it "Written in advance so it can cost me. The body is at spawn, the panel is in configuration B, two meter cells are burned, the next command index is 6. ACTION3 AT SPAWN, which is what the playbook asks for: my manual predicts ZERO cells changed and has no witness for that at this cell. If the body steps east I am wrong by 48 pixels, ACTION3 IS EAST and the map closes; if only (63,61) burns I am wrong by one pixel, the meter is command parity rather than key-driven, and ACTION4 is east by elimination; if nothing at all changes then ACTION3 is not a direction key here, ACTION4 is east by elimination, and the key-driven meter reading survives. THREE OUTCOMES AND ALL THREE ARE INFORMATIVE, which is the property I am buying. ACTION4 at spawn: the same experiment with the labels swapped, except that a burn there is uninformative about the meter because 4 is an even key. ACTION2 at spawn: 48 body cells I draw correctly, plus one burn I do NOT draw since meter_burn_key2_next is out of the manual -- one wrong pixel, one free datum in the cascade length, and no new witness. ACTION5 at spawn: my manual predicts nothing and has no witness; if the panel moves, eight rules are guarded on the wrong atom and I want to know. ACTION1 at spawn: witnessed silence, nothing bought, the only strictly worthless press on the board."

=== PLAYBOOK ===
```
# playbook.dsl -- what to buy with the next command, not a route.
#
# ========= WHERE THE ROUND ACTUALLY WENT =========
# No command was adjudicated this round. certify returned an EMPTY replay,
# an EMPTY responsibility map and unambiguous null, because theory.py was
# never generated: the manual did not compile. One landmark line carried
# prose where the grammar demands a coordinate. Nothing else could run.
# The manual is repaired and rewritten against the observation record as it
# now stands -- 6 states, 5 transitions -- and it should replay 5/5 with no
# priced-in miss. THE FIRST THING TO CHECK NEXT ROUND IS THAT CERTIFY HAD
# SOMETHING TO RUN. A compile failure is invisible to every other check.
#
# ========= THE BOARD AS THE MANUAL NOW SEES IT =========
#   Body at lattice (1,2), spawn. Panel in configuration B. Two meter cells
#   burned, cols 62-63 of row 63. Next command index is 6.
#
#   At spawn:  key(2) -> 48 body cells south, WITNESSED at t2
#              key(1) -> nothing, WITNESSED at t1
#              key(3), key(4), key(5) -> nothing, NO WITNESS AT THIS CELL
#
#   Open neighbours of spawn are DOWN and RIGHT only; up and left are void.
#   ACTION1 was pressed here and moved nothing, so it is neither.
#   At (2,2) the open neighbours were UP and DOWN only; ACTION3 and ACTION4
#   were each pressed there and moved nothing, so NEITHER IS VERTICAL.
#   If either is a direction key at all, IT IS HORIZONTAL.
#
# ========= THE ONE THING WORTH BUYING, AND IT PAYS TWICE =========
# PRESS ACTION3 FROM SPAWN.
#   (1) It settles the east key. Body steps -> ACTION3 is east and the map
#       closes. Body still -> ACTION4 is east by elimination. Either answer
#       names it, and east of spawn is three lattice cells of unbroken
#       floor while west is void, so the test is free at this cell.
#   (2) It separates the two meter readings AT NO EXTRA COST. Both readings
#       fit t1-t5 identically because every even index carried an even key.
#       Index 6 is EVEN and key 3 is ODD: key-driven predicts no burn,
#       command-parity predicts (63,61) burns. No other single command
#       splits them.
#   (3) It converts one of three forged silences at spawn into a witness.
#   ACTION4 is the same probe minus benefit (2), so it is the fallback and
#   not the choice.
#
# THE ADVERTISED PRICE OF A STEP ONTO FRESH GROUND: 48 pixels the manual
# cannot draw. Rows 8-12 cols 20-24 have never changed, so they are board
# and no rule may draw their first change; the 24 departure pixels need an
# east-leaves rule that cannot be written before an east press witnesses
# one. 24 pixels for the second step, 0 for the third. A refutation whose
# divergence set is exactly that block is the price, not a defect.
#
# TWO PRICES ALREADY POSTED, so neither can be read as a surprise:
#   - the panel toggle-back rules are OUT of the manual for want of a
#     witness in this record, so the next effective ACTION5 costs 23 pixels
#     if the panel does toggle back.
#   - meter_burn_key2_next is OUT for the same reason, so a second ACTION2
#     costs one pixel.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE MAP, FOR WHEN THE DIRECTION KEYS ARE NAMED. Eleven lattice cells are
# reachable and the body has stood in two. Every route south crosses (6,2),
# 23 of whose 25 pixels are colour 8; lattice column 2 is the only
# north-south corridor, so the comb is the door and not an obstacle. The
# comb is the near end of ONE connected colour-8 wire whose far end is a
# 3x3 knob beside lattice (1,5), three steps east along lattice row 1. The
# socket at (8,7) is drawn as three colour-9 walls with a pip at its exact
# centre -- a keyhole shaped for a body with an aperture -- and it is south
# of the comb. So: open the gate before planning anything south of it, and
# the gate is reached by going EAST, which is the key nobody has pressed.
