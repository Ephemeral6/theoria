# playbook.dsl -- what to buy with the next command, not a route.
#
# STATE: six states, five transitions (RESET, A1, A2, A3, A4, A7). Widget in
# configuration W0 -- colour-3 bar in the TOP slot, hollow colour-6 box in the
# BOTTOM slot. BOTH readouts blank (colour 4). (53,63) advanced to 3 at t4.
# 97 cells have ever changed; certify reports 0 unexplained pixels in 4096.
#
# WHAT CHANGED THIS ROUND. Replay was 4/5, diverging at t=0 on exactly four
# cells: (40,13) (40,14) (41,13) (41,14), the bottom two rows of the bar's
# landing site. The bar is six rows tall on top and FOUR rows tall on the
# bottom. Two rules became four; nothing else moved. The separator I used --
# the colour two rows above -- is a FIT, not a law, and the manual says so.
#
# THE STRUCTURAL QUESTION THAT IS NOW OPEN AND WAS NOT BEFORE
#   Reading A, exchange: two slots trade images and the bar renders shorter
#     below. Reading B, scroll: a list of >=3 items scrolls by 6 and the
#     four-row glyph is a THIRD ITEM, not the bar.
#   From W0 the two are the same map, so nothing observed splits them. A
#   SECOND CONSECUTIVE ACTION1 splits them in one command: A returns W0,
#   B shows a configuration never seen. My rules fire on nothing in W1, so
#   they predict silence there -- the largest forged silence in the file.
#
# WHAT IS GENUINELY UNKNOWN
#   * ACTION5 and ACTION6: never pressed in any state. Zero constraint.
#   * ACTION1 in W1, ACTION2 in W0: never pressed, silence forged, 18 rules
#     and one structural reading riding on each.
#   * Whether ACTION4 advances the meter always, or only when it lights the
#     readout, or whether the meter runs on the command index. One witness
#     cannot split three readings and the index reading is inexpressible.
#   * ACTION3 vs ACTION7: identical net effect, 2 frames vs 1. Not the same
#     action inside; cascade single_frame throws away the only evidence.
#   * The win condition. Nothing countable separates a win from here.
#
# PRICES ADVERTISED IN ADVANCE, SO A REFUTATION ON THEM IMPLICATES NOTHING
#   * (53,62) is board, holds no instance, is UNDRAWABLE. Every meter advance
#     after the first costs exactly one pixel of accuracy, permanently.
#   * ACTION1 here is predicted at 72 cells, NOT 96, and the four truncation
#     cells are predicted to become 5, not 3. That is the fix on trial.
#   * ACTION1 in W1 and ACTION2 in W0 are predicted silent with no witness.
#     A refutation there is a purchase, not a defect.
#
# THE RANKED LIST
# 1. ACTION5 or ACTION6. Never pressed in six states. Any outcome is the
#    largest single addition available -- including "nothing", which would be
#    the first WITNESSED inertness in this world. The ranker prices these at
#    zero because my manual is silent on them; that is a fact about my manual.
# 2. ACTION1, then ACTION1 AGAIN. The first press is cheap confirmation of the
#    truncation fix and is fully predicted; the second is the only command
#    that splits exchange from scroll and it tests an 18-rule forged silence
#    at the same time. Two commands, two distinct purchases, no waste.
# 3. ACTION2, HERE, IN W0. Tests a zero-witness silence covering 18 rules. If
#    it exchanges, the toggle is key-symmetric and 18 rules generalise free.
# 4. ACTION4 A SECOND TIME, once the readout is lit. The only way to split
#    "key 4 advances the meter" from "lighting the readout advances it".
#    Costs a meter cell; read the answer off the RAW DIFF, since the
#    divergence lands on (53,62) which I cannot draw either way.
#
# WHAT NOT TO PRESS
#   ACTION3 or ACTION7 here: the pattern they erase is already erased, my
#   manual predicts identity AND I believe it. Confirmed silence, no witness.
#   Anything chosen because my manual predicts the most pixels for it: that
#   number measures my coverage, not the world's information.
