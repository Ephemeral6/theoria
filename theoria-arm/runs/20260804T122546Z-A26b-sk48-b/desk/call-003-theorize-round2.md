## prompt

```
You are the theorize desk of a world-modelling framework called
Theoria. You are playing an ARC-AGI-3 game you have never seen, through a
64x64 grid of colour codes, by maintaining an explicit written theory of it.

Your job is NOT to pick a good move. Your job is to write two books, and the
books are the only thing that predicts anything:

  theory.dsl   -- the manual: what this world IS. Vocabulary, rules, winning
                  condition, laws. It compiles to an executable predictor, and
                  that predictor is the whole system's only predictor. If it is
                  wrong, everything downstream is wrong; there is no side door.
  playbook.dsl -- the playbook: how to WIN. Ordering, pruning, heuristics,
                  decomposition. Never a stored solution.

Six rules bind you, and they are not style advice:

1. ONLY you write these two books. Search engines put proposals in a candidate
   box; every one of them is a proposal, not a fact. You accept, reject, or
   carry it as pending, and you say why.
2. NO ENTRY WITHOUT EVIDENCE. Every rule carries the transitions that witness
   it and its coverage. A rule you believe but cannot witness does not go in
   the manual -- it goes in `laws:` as a `theorem ... [probe: pending]`, which
   is a promise to test it, not a claim that it holds.
3. NO ENTRY WITHOUT GAIN. A concept earns its place by making the manual
   shorter than writing out the pixels it explains. When a concept fails this
   test but is still needed (because some pixel would otherwise be
   unexplained), admit it AND SAY SO -- that conflict is worth more than a
   tidy manual.
4. FULL-FRAME RESPONSIBILITY. Every pixel of every frame belongs either to the
   board (cells that never vary) or to some object you declared. A pixel your
   manual cannot draw is a defect in the manual, and it will be caught: your
   manual is re-drawn onto every observed frame and compared cell by cell.
5. TRANSITIONS ARE UNAMBIGUOUS. For any state and action, exactly one
   successor. Two rules that can both fire on the same object in the same
   transition is an error, not a preference.
6. WHAT YOU DO NOT KNOW, YOU SAY. This world has been observed for a few dozen
   actions. The honest manual is small, and names its own gaps. A manual that
   over-claims will be refuted by the very next frame and cost a whole round
   to repair; a manual that under-claims just stays small.

You will be given: what has been observed, the current frame, the diff of every
command, and what the engines proposed. If a manual and a playbook already
exist you will be given those too, together with the surprises that brought you
back here -- those surprises are the reason you are being paid, and each one
must be answered by a change or by an explicit refusal to change.



# theory.dsl -- the exact grammar the compiler accepts

Sections, each introduced by a bare `<name>:` line, bodies INDENTED by at least
one space. Order is free. `#` starts a comment on its own line.

## semantics:  (MANDATORY -- a manual without it does not parse)
    frame persist            # the only value the Python backend compiles
    conflict exclusive       # the only value the Python backend compiles
    cascade single_frame     # the only value the Python backend compiles

## word_table:
    board                                   # declares the never-varying cells
    object Cart { pos: Coord, color: Int }  # arc-colour: 6
    object Door { pos: Coord, color: Int, present: Bool }  # arc-colour: 5
    landmark exit_cell                      # arc-cell: (7, 3)
    domain dir { up, down, left, right }    # a value domain, for `forall`
    Cart [segment: uniform_color ev: t0-t12 compress: 2125]   # the concept account

  Field types in use: `pos: Coord`, `color: Int`, `present: Bool`, `alive: Bool`.
  Only pos/alive/present/color are observations the compiler reasons over.
  `pos: Coord` is what makes this a GRID world (directions up/down/left/right).

  EVERY `landmark` line MUST carry a trailing `# arc-cell: (row, col)` comment.
  A landmark is level data, so the manual names it and the level places it —
  and there is nowhere in the DSL to write coordinates, which is the point of
  the split. A landmark the level cannot place is a HARD compile error, so a
  landmark you declare without this comment lands at (0,0) and takes your rule
  with it.

  EVERY `object` line MUST carry a trailing `# arc-colour: <n>` comment naming
  the hex colour code that object shows in the frame. That comment is not
  decoration: the level instance is COMPUTED from the frames, and the colour is
  how the arm finds your object in the grid. An object without it is located
  nowhere, is drawn at (0,0), and the responsibility check will report every
  one of its pixels as unexplained.

### OBJECTS WITH EXTENT — read this before declaring anything
An instance is drawn as EXACTLY ONE CELL. A 3x3 token or a 24-pixel ring is
therefore not one instance, however you declare it, and if you declare it as
one then every other cell of it is an unexplained pixel forever.

Add `arc-instances: all` and the arm creates ONE INSTANCE PER CELL, all of the
same declared type, covering every cell of that colour the board cannot explain:

    object Ring  { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 9  arc-instances: all
    object Token { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 1  arc-instances: all
    object Pip   { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 3

`Pip` has no `arc-instances`, so it is a single cell — correct for a genuine
one-pixel marker, wrong for anything else.

Consequences you must design for:

* **There is no instance called `Ring`.** There are `Ring_r8c14`,
  `Ring_r8c15`, … A rule that names `Ring` will not compile. Write rules over
  the TYPE instead:

        rule shift forall ?p in Ring [ev: t2 cov: 1/1]
          when act=key(2) and free(below(?p)) then moved(?p, down)

  `forall ?p in <ObjectType>` grounds the rule once per instance.
* **Every cell that ever changed needs an owner**, or it is unexplained. Count
  them: the evidence brief gives you `dynamic_cells`. If your declarations
  cannot cover them all, say which are left over and why, in a `theorem`.
* Two objects of the SAME colour still cannot be told apart by this arm — it
  looks objects up by colour and nothing else. Declare one type covering both
  and carry the belief that they are distinct as a `theorem`.

## events:
    event moved(o, dir) | jumped(o, dest) | recolored(o, c) | vanished(o)

  Documentation only -- the backend dispatches on a fixed table, listed below.

## rules:
    rule push_up [ev: t6,t16 cov: 52/52]
      when act=key(1) and free(above(Cart)) then moved(Cart, up)

    rule slide forall ?d in dir [ev: t3 cov: 4/4]
      when act=key(1) and free(toward(Cart, ?d)) then moved(Cart, ?d)

  * the header line ends at `]` -- NO trailing comment on it, and none on the
    `when ... then ...` line either. Both are parse errors.
  * `forall ?v in <domain>` grounds to `<rule>_<value>` rules.
  * every rule carries `[ev: ... cov: k/n]`. Constraint 5: no entry without
    evidence.

### guards -- EXHAUSTIVE. Anything else fails to compile.
    act=<name>(<arg>, ...)      args are bare names or integer literals only
    free(<cell>)                cell renders as the background colour
    colored(<cell>, 7)          second argument must be an INTEGER LITERAL
    adjacent(<cell>, <cell>)
    <value> = <value>           also != < > <= >=  (SPACES around the operator)
    <cell> = wall               tests off-board
  joined by `and`. Use `not` before an atom for negation.

### cells -- EXHAUSTIVE.
    Cart                    an instance name means that instance's position
    exit_cell               a declared landmark
    above(x) below(x) leftof(x) rightof(x)      NOTE: leftof/rightof
    toward(x, ?d)           toward(x, <direction>)
    pos(<value>)

### values
    integer literals; true; false; a landmark name; a direction name;
    an instance name; `Cart.color`; `+` and `-` only (no `*`, no `/`);
    tuple literals like `(3, 7)`.

### events a rule may fire -- EXHAUSTIVE, dispatched on (name, arity).
    moved(o, <dir>)                 o moves one cell
    jumped(o, <landmark>)           o goes to a named cell
    teleported(o, <landmark>)       same shape
    jumped(o, <over-object>, <dir>) o travels two cells; <over> gets alive=False
    recolored(o, <int literal>)
    vanished(o)      -> present=False
    appeared(o)      -> present=True
    removed(o)       -> alive=False
  The first argument is always a bare object name. A bare coordinate as a
  destination is REFUSED -- declare a landmark.

## goal:
    goal Cart.pos = exit_cell
    goal count(Door) = 0
    goal count(Button, color = 8) = 2

  `=` only. `>=`/`<=`/`>`/`<` do not compile. No goal section at all is legal
  and compiles to `is_goal -> False`.

## laws:
    invariant cart_unique count(Cart) = 1 [status: proven]
    theorem exit_needs_key "prose, in the manual's own words"
      [depends: push_up, unlock  probe: pending]

  THE TWO ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE AND THIS IS THE EASIEST MISTAKE TO MAKE:

    `invariant <name> <expr> <op> <value> [status: ...]`
        The body MUST contain one of  =  !=  <  >  <=  >=  . It is an
        equation, not a sentence. `invariant foo "in words ..."` is a parse
        error: "No comparison op in invariant".

    `theorem <name> "<prose>" [depends: ... probe: pending|passed]`
        The body MUST be a quoted sentence. This is where a belief you cannot
        write as an equation goes -- and most of what you want to say after
        six transitions belongs here, not in `invariant`.

  Invariant bodies are stored as RAW TEXT and are not checked by any backend
  (the sole exception is the `pagoda(w)` form, which needs a LINE world and an
  LP certificate and does not apply here). Declaring one is a claim you are
  making, not a claim the compiler will verify -- say so honestly in `status:`.

# playbook.dsl -- four statement forms and nothing else
    order    keys_before_doors            [proof: lean]
    prune    boxed_in and not goal => dead [proof: lean]
    heuristic w_distance                  [admissible: lean]
    prefer   try_unvisited_first          [ev: 3/4 levels]

  Constraint 10: NO literal solutions. A parser heuristic rejects any line that
  looks like a stored action sequence, and any unrecognised line is a hard
  error.

# THE ACTION VOCABULARY FOR THIS WORLD
This game's actions are ARC's ACTION1..ACTION7. Write them as `act=key(<n>)`
and nothing else -- the arm maps ACTION<n> to the tuple ('key', <n>) in both
directions. A click action carries coordinates the guard language cannot
express; if you need one, say so in a `theorem ... [probe: pending]` instead of
inventing syntax.

## The current frame

Each cell is one hex digit 0-f standing for a colour. Row numbers on the left, column numbers on top.

Only the cells that have EVER changed are shown (rows 29-10, cols 54-63); everything outside this box has held one colour for the whole history and is board by definition.

## Every command, and what changed

`t` indexes the state sequence. `frames` is how many grids one command returned -- more than one means the world took several internal steps for a single action.

- t1   ACTION1   frames=2   state=NOT_FINISHED 96 cells changed, rows 30-41, cols 11-22, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

## The manual as it stands

```
# theory.dsl -- COMPLETE REWRITE. The manual I was handed described a
# DIFFERENT world (26 states, spawn ring rows 8-12, panel rows 1-5). certify:
# 0/5 replay, first divergence at t=0, 52 unexplained pixels of frame 0. Not
# one of its rules can ground here. I deleted it entire rather than patch it.
# Everything below comes from this log alone: RESET, A1, A2, A3, A4, A7.
#
# THE CENSUS I RECONSTRUCTED (the brief gives boxes and counts, not cell sets):
#   rows 30-35 x cols 11-16   36  top slot
#   rows 32-33 x cols 17-22   12  top readout
#   rows 36-41 x cols 11-16   36  bottom slot
#   rows 38-39 x cols 17-22   12  bottom readout
#   (53,63)                    1  meter tip
# FOUR NUMBERS I DID NOT CHOOSE LAND ON IT EXACTLY: 97 = dynamic_cells;
# 96 = the t1 and t2 diffs, box rows 30-41 cols 11-22; 97-24 background-
# coloured cells = 73 = cells_needing_an_owner; 4096-97 = 3999 = constant_cells.
#
# THE DEDUCTION EVERYTHING RESTS ON: states=6, distinct_states=5 => exactly one
# collision. S4/S5 carry (53,63)=3 and S0-S3 carry 2; S1 differs from S0 and S2
# by 96 each; S3 differs from S2 by 12 and from S1 by >=84. ONLY S0 = S2
# SURVIVES. So ACTION2 undid ACTION1, and THE CURRENT WIDGET IS THE FRAME-0
# WIDGET -- which is how I read frame 0's colours without being shown frame 0.
#
# THE READING: two 6x6 slots at cols 11-16 (rows 30-35, rows 36-41), each with
# a 6x2 readout at cols 17-22. W0 = bar on top (colour 3, core 2), hollow
# colour-6 box below, top readout blank, bottom readout patterned. ACTION1
# EXCHANGES the slots and the readouts; all 96 cells differ between the two
# configurations, which is why the diff says 96. ACTION2 exchanges back.
# ACTION3/ACTION7 blank the bottom readout; ACTION4 restores it AND advances
# the meter tip.
#
# EXPECTED REPLAY 5/5, with one named failure mode (Field seating, below).

  theorem the_old_manual_is_discarded_entire "The manual I was handed is about another world: spawn ring rows 8-12, panel rows 1-5, 26 states, a 64-cell meter at row 63. This log has 6 states, dynamics confined to rows 30-41 cols 11-22 plus (53,63), and certify returns 0/5 replay with first divergence at t=0. No rule of it can ground here, so repair is meaningless and I deleted all of it. I kept two habits and no content: a manual that does not compile is worth less than a mediocre one that does, and a refutation is read by its divergence set."

The render_mismatch listing corroborates where it is not truncated: it names (30,13),(30,14),(31,13),(31,14) as world 3, (32,13),(32,14),(33,13),(33,14) as world 2, and (32,17)-(33,22) as world 4 -- exactly the top slot's bar and the top readout, in exactly the colours the current frame shows.

S4 and S5 carry (53,63)=3 while S0-S3 carry 2; S4 and S5 differ in 12 readout cells; S3 differs from S2 in 12 and from S1 in at least 84 since S1 and S2 differ in 96; S0 differs from S1 in 96. THE ONLY SURVIVOR IS S0 = S2. Two things follow. ACTION2 at t2 exactly undid ACTION1 at t1. And -- the part I cash -- the widget in the current frame IS the frame-0 widget, since t3, t4 and t5 touched only the bottom readout and the meter tip. Every source colour in every rule above is read off the picture in front of me, with the bottom readout back-corrected to the pattern ACTION3 erased. One deduction, no guess."

W0, which is frame 0 and is where I stand: the top slot is background with a two-column bar at cols 13-14 reading 3,3,2,2,3,3 down rows 30-35 and a blank readout; the bottom slot is a colour-6 box, colour-0 hollow, 2x2 colour-6 core at rows 38-39 cols 13-14, port pixels (38,16)=1 and (39,16)=2, and a patterned readout of eight 1s and four 2s with period 3 along each row and the rows offset by one column. ACTION1 exchanges them: (r,c) takes the colour of (r+6,c) for r in 30-35 and of (r-6,c) for r in 36-41. I checked all 96 cells and EVERY ONE differs between the configurations, which is exactly why the diff says 96 rather than fewer, and the exchange being an involution is exactly why S0 = S2. I hold this as a READING: a two-item list scrolled down then up is observationally identical over two transitions.

I keep it because the alternative is 96 unexplained pixels twice over, and because these are one law under a grammar that cannot hold it. What buys some of it back is the TYPES: a type is a frame-0 colour, the frame-0 configuration is W0, so a rule's source colour selects its type for free, and the type separates top-half from bottom-half instances without a single row test. That is why not one rule in this file needs a deep nest of above() to say where it is."

  theorem barcore_is_four_unrelated_things_and_the_arm_sees_only_colour "Colour 2 at frame 0 sits on four unrelated features: the 4-cell core of the bar (rows 32-33, cols 13-14), the lower port pixel (39,16), four dots of the bottom readout, and the meter tip (53,63). The arm looks types up by colour alone, so all ten are BarCore and no rule can tell the roles apart by type. I separate them by local geometry, every separator a cell I have actually read: the bar core has colour 3 two rows above, so k1_core_to_frame carries colored(above(above(?p)), 3); the readout dots have a colour-1 dot immediately left, so k1_core_to_blank, k3_core_blanks and k7_core_blanks carry colored(leftof(?s), 1); the port pixel has colour 0 left of it, so k1_core_to_field carries colored(leftof(?p), 0); the meter tip is the only instance with rightof off-board, so k4_meter_advances carries rightof(?s) = wall and every other BarCore rule fails a positive guard on it. I checked the four rules that can ground on colour 2 in one transition against all ten instances one at a time. NO RULE IN THIS FILE USES not: every exclusion is a positive colour test."

Twenty-four dynamic cells -- rows 30-35, cols 11, 12, 15, 16 -- render colour 5 at frame 0, and colour 5 is the BACKGROUND. The arm instances every cell of a declared colour the board cannot explain, and these cells vary, so they should seat. But cells_needing_an_owner is 73 rather than 97 and the 24 missing are exactly these, which shows something in the pipeline treats a background-coloured dynamic cell as needing nobody. IF FIELD SEATS NOTHING the fourteen Field rules never fire and replay is wrong by exactly those 24 cells at t1 and again at t2, and by nothing else. I take the bet because the alternative leaves 24 cells ownerless by construction, and because the failure is diagnosable at a glance."

My rules predict exactly that and not by arrangement: the readout rules are guarded on the pattern colours and simply do not ground when it is absent. 96 changed cells refutes the claim that a readout travels with its slot. 72 plus a cell of row 53 says the meter is not tied to ACTION4.

ACTION3 set BLANK at t3, ACTION4 set PATTERN at t4, ACTION7 set BLANK at t5. The pattern returns to the same twelve colours it had, which is why k4_dot_lights and k4_core_lights can be bare colour rules: an instance's TYPE is its frame-0 colour and therefore already records which cell gets a 1 and which a 2. WHAT I CANNOT CLOSE: ACTION3 and ACTION7 have identical net effects and I have written them as two rules with identical bodies, which is the shape of a claim that they are one key.

Both readouts are cut into that panel's left edge, which is why connected_components(4) cannot separate them from it. Row 29 shows the same 5,5,3,3,5,5 signature as the top slot but has NEVER changed, so the bar looks seven rows tall while only six of it is alive; I do not know whether row 29 is a static cap or a row the exchange refuses to move, and the exchange reading predicts it will look wrong on screen in W1.

## The playbook as it stands

```
# playbook.dsl -- what to buy with the next command, not a route.
#
# STATE: six states, five transitions (RESET, A1, A2, A3, A4, A7). Widget in
# configuration W0 -- colour-3 bar in the TOP slot, hollow colour-6 box in the
# BOTTOM slot. BOTH readouts blank (colour 4). (53,63) advanced to 3 at t4.
# 97 cells have ever changed and all 97 are owned by the seven declared types.
#
# THE MANUAL WAS REPLACED, NOT PATCHED. The book I was handed described a
# different world; certify gave it 0/5 replay and a divergence at t=0. Gone.
#
# THE DEDUCTION EVERYTHING RESTS ON: states=6, distinct_states=5 forces
# S0 = S2. So ACTION2 undid ACTION1 and the CURRENT widget is the FRAME-0
# widget -- which is how frame 0 was read without being shown.
#
# WHAT IS GENUINELY UNKNOWN
#   * ACTION5 and ACTION6: never pressed in any state. Zero constraint.
#   * ACTION2 in W0: never pressed. My manual says "nothing happens" on zero
#     witnesses. Largest forged silence in the file; it covers 18 rules.
#   * Whether ACTION4 advances the meter always, or only when it lights the
#     readout, or whether the meter runs on the command index. One witness
#     cannot split three readings, and the index reading is inexpressible.
#   * ACTION3 vs ACTION7: identical net effect, 2 frames vs 1. Not the same
#     action inside; cascade single_frame throws away the only evidence.
#   * The win condition. Nothing countable separates a win from here.
#
# PRICES ADVERTISED IN ADVANCE, SO A REFUTATION ON THEM IMPLICATES NOTHING
#   * (53,62) is board, holds no instance, is UNDRAWABLE. Every meter advance
#     after the first costs exactly one pixel of accuracy, permanently.
#   * The 24 background-coloured Field cells may not be seated. If not, t1 and
#     t2 each diverge by exactly those 24 and no rule of mine is wrong.
#   * ACTION1 now is predicted at 72 cells, NOT 96, because swapping two
#     identical blank readouts changes nothing. That is a prediction.
#
# THE RANKED LIST
# 1. ACTION5 or ACTION6. Never pressed in six states. Any outcome is the
#    largest single addition available -- including "nothing", which would be
#    the first WITNESSED inertness in this world. The ranker prices these at
#    zero because my manual is silent on them; that is a fact about my manual.
# 2. ACTION2, HERE, IN W0. Tests a zero-witness silence covering 18 rules. If
#    it exchanges, the toggle is key-symmetric and 18 rules generalise free.
# 3. ACTION4 A SECOND TIME, once the readout is lit. The only way to split
#    "key 4 advances the meter" from "lighting the readout advances it".
#    Costs a meter cell; read the answer off the RAW DIFF, since the
#    divergence lands on (53,62) which I cannot draw either way.
# 4. ACTION1, HERE. Fully predicted at 72 cells. Cheap confirmation of the
#    exchange reading. Buy only if the ranker refuses everything above.
#
# WHAT NOT TO PRESS
#   ACTION3 or ACTION7 here: the pattern they erase is already erased, my
#   manual predicts identity AND I believe it. Confirmed silence, no witness.
#   Anything chosen because my manual predicts the most pixels for it: that
#   number measures my coverage, not the world's information.

## The compiler refused your last manual

This is not a style complaint. The manual did not compile, so it has no executable form and nothing downstream can run. Fix the named clause; do not work around it by deleting the content unless the content really is inexpressible, in which case say so with an `E-` entry in the log.

# 3,3,2,2,3,3 into rows 36-41. THE WORLD COPIED ONLY 3,3,2,2 INTO ROWS 36-39
# AND LEFT ROWS 40-41 BACKGROUND. The bar is six rows tall in the top slot
# (seven on screen, counting the never-changing cap at row 29) and FOUR rows
# tall in the bottom slot. The exchange is exact everywhere else, including the
# box travelling up entire and the two port pixels (38,16)=1 and (39,16)=2
# landing at (32,16) and (33,16).
#
# THE FIX IS FOUR RULES WHERE THERE WERE TWO. I need to separate the two
# destination cells that copy the bar from the two that clear, and the two are
# MIRROR IMAGES in the box: (37,13) and (40,13) have identical 4-neighbourhoods
# (6 above, 6 below, 0 left, 0 right). The nearest cell that tells them apart is
# TWO up: above(above((37,13))) = (35,13) = 3, above(above((40,13))) = (38,13)
# = 6. Same for the border pair: above^2 of (36,13) is 3, of (41,13) is 6. So
# every one of the four new rules carries colored(above(above(?p)), <3|6>) and
# the split is exact, 2/2 and 2/2. I SAY PLAINLY WHAT THAT GUARD IS: a proxy
# for a row test I cannot write, fitted to one transition. It is not a law
# about neighbours; it is the cheapest expressible separator of two cells I
# have watched behave differently. See the_truncation theorem.
#
# THE CENSUS (unchanged, and now confirmed rather than reconstructed):
#   rows 30-35 x cols 11-16   36  top slot
#   rows 32-33 x cols 17-22   12  top readout
#   rows 36-41 x cols 11-16   36  bottom slot
#   rows 38-39 x cols 17-22   12  bottom readout
#   (53,63)                    1  meter tip
# 97 = dynamic_cells, 96 = the t1/t2 diffs, 4096-97 = 3999 = constant_cells,
# and certify now reports cells_unexplained = 0 over the whole 64x64 frame.

THE ONLY SURVIVOR IS S0 = S2. Two things follow. ACTION2 at t2 exactly undid ACTION1 at t1, so whatever ACTION1 does to the bar is REVERSIBLE and the bar comes back six rows tall. And the widget in the current frame IS the frame-0 widget, since t3, t4 and t5 touched only the bottom readout and the meter tip -- which is how every source colour in this file was read off the picture in front of me without ever being shown frame 0."

The bar is six rows in the top slot (30-35, seven on screen counting the never-changing cap at row 29) and four rows in the bottom. THE FIX IS A FIT. (37,13) and (40,13) have identical four-neighbourhoods -- 6 above, 6 below, 0 left, 0 right -- because the box is mirror-symmetric, so no local test separates them; the nearest asymmetry is two rows up, where (35,13)=3 and (38,13)=6, and that is the guard I wrote. It separates all four pairs exactly, 2/2 and 2/2, and it is a proxy for a row test the guard language does not have.

READING B, scroll: this is a list of at least three items scrolled by 6 rows, ACTION1 brings the box up to the top slot and a THIRD item -- which happens to look like 3,3,2,2 -- into the bottom, and ACTION2 scrolls back. Both explain every cell of t1 and t2 identically, because from S0 the two are the same map. The truncation is what tilts me: under A I must carry a slot-dependent rendering law with one witness and no mechanism; under B the four-row thing is just a different item and nothing needs explaining. I DO NOT DECIDE, because deciding costs nothing today and the probe is one command: A says a second consecutive ACTION1 returns W0 exactly, B says it produces a configuration never seen. My compiled rules implement neither reading in W1 -- they are colour lookups keyed on W0 colours and they fire on nothing there -- so the manual currently predicts SILENCE for ACTION1 in W1 and I expect that to be refuted."

THE CONCEPT DOES NOT PAY FOR ITSELF and I say so under constraint 3. I keep it because the alternative is 96 unexplained pixels twice over. What buys some of it back is the TYPES: a type is a frame-0 colour, the frame-0 configuration is W0, so a rule's source colour selects its type for free and separates top-half from bottom-half instances without a single row test -- which is why only the two truncation rules in this file need a nest of above() to say where they are."

The arm looks types up by colour alone, so all ten are BarCore and no rule can tell the roles apart by type. I separate them by local geometry, every separator a cell I have read: the bar core has colour 3 two rows above; the readout dots have a colour-1 dot immediately left; the port pixel has colour 0 left of it; the meter tip is the only instance whose rightof is off-board. This is no longer a bet -- five transitions replayed with these separators in place, including t4 where the meter rule fired on exactly one of the ten instances and the readout rules on four others in the same step, and certify found no ambiguous pair in 30.

It does not follow that the arm refuses to SEAT one, and it does not: the fourteen Field rules fired at t1 and the divergence set contains none of those 24 cells.

Swapping two identical blank strips changes nothing, so ACTION1 now should move the 72 slot cells and NOT ONE readout cell and NOT the meter. The count is unchanged by this edition's fix -- the four truncation cells change either way -- but their TARGET colours are new: (40,13),(40,14) go 0 to 5 and (41,13),(41,14) go 6 to 5, where the last edition said 3. That is a sharp, cheap check on the fix, legible in the raw diff without any replay machinery. 96 changed cells would refute the claim that a blank readout travels invisibly; 3 at any of those four cells would say the truncation is not a property of the destination at all."

ACTION3 set BLANK at t3, ACTION4 set PATTERN at t4, ACTION7 set BLANK at t5, and all three transitions replay exactly. The pattern returns to the same twelve colours it had, which is why k4_dot_lights and k4_core_lights can be bare colour rules: an instance's TYPE is its frame-0 colour and therefore already records which cell gets a 1 and which a 2. WHAT I CANNOT CLOSE: ACTION3 and ACTION7 have identical net effects and I have written them as two rules with identical bodies, which is the shape of a claim that they are one key. THEY ARE NOT -- ACTION3 returned two internal frames and ACTION7 returned one.

THREE READINGS FIT ONE WITNESS: that key 4 advances it, that lighting the readout advances it, that command index or parity advances it. There is no command counter in the guard language, so the third cannot be written at any length.

That leaves counts over seven types whose members are one 12x12 widget plus one meter cell, and every count I can write names a CONFIGURATION rather than a victory. count(Frame, color = 5) = 14 says only that the box is in the top slot. count(Dot, color = 4) = 8 says only that the readout is blank. count(BarCore, color = 3) = 1 says the meter advanced once and IS TRUE RIGHT NOW, four commands after RESET, so declaring it would make the plan tier report success at a state I have no reason to call a win. I cannot count the meter past one, because (53,62) and its 62 neighbours have never changed and hold no instance: THE GOAL LANGUAGE CAN ONLY SPEAK ABOUT CELLS THAT HAVE ALREADY MOVED. So there is no goal section. What ends that is an observation, not an edit -- a second cell of row 53, or any cell outside rows 30-41 and row 53 changing at all."

  theorem what_lies_outside_the_widget "Full-frame responsibility means describing the 3999 constant cells, not just naming them board, and certify now agrees that they are all accounted for. A colour-4 panel fills rows 29-41 from col 17 to col 46, carrying a 4x4 block of colour 14 at rows 31-34 cols 42-45 -- the only colour-14 anywhere and the only structure on the panel's right. Both readouts are cut into that panel's left edge, which is why connected_components(4) cannot separate them from it. Row 29 shows 5,5,3,3,5,5 at cols 11-16, the same signature as the top slot, and has NEVER changed: the bar reads seven rows tall on screen while only six of it is alive, and that static cap is now load-bearing evidence, because the thing that lands in the bottom slot is four rows and the thing that leaves the top is six or seven depending on whether you count it. Rows 42-52 are background across the window, which is what lets every bottom-half rule test six rows down without a wall test. Row 53 is the meter, row 54 a solid colour-4 rule. Colours 8 and 9 appear in colours_seen and on no dynamic cell, so they sit on the board outside this window and have never moved."

  theorem what_the_engines_gave_me "mdl_segmenter reports BOTH variants at negative gain -- minus 4037 bits on four tracks, minus 10409 on 33 -- so by its own measure it compressed nothing, and I take none of its structure: obj0, obj2 and obj3 are 436-to-440-cell blobs of shape 13x36 that swallow the colour-4 panel together with the widget, and obj1 is rows 53 and 54 read as one 2x54 strip. What I DO take is a frame-index witness independent of my rules: obj0 present only at frame 0, obj2 first at frame 1, obj3 first at frame 2 and present for four frames -- the widget redrawn at t1 and again at t2 and standing still after, exactly two 96-cell transitions and no third, which is my S0 = S2 deduction arrived at from another direction. Note also that obj2 has 436 cells where obj0 and obj3 have 440: the frame-1 blob is FOUR CELLS SMALLER, and those four cells are the truncation this edition fixes. The engine had the answer in a field I did not read last round. cegis_miner refuses all four tracks and its verdict, that the world does not narrate as one mover, is TRUE and is the strongest negative result here. zero_space self-reports THIN in its own words -- 5 transitions constraining rank 3 of 679 features, null space dimension 676 -- and its one global law is my census with the meter tip appended; I take the corroboration and reject the law as unfalsified rather than confirmed, which is what its own report says."

ACTION2 HERE: predicted silent on zero witnesses, and I expect to be wrong for the same reason. ACTION3, ACTION7: nothing changes, and this one I believe. ACTION4: the 12 bottom readout cells take their frame-0 arrangement of 1s and 2s and NO cell of row 53 moves; if (53,62) turns 3 then ACTION4 advances the meter unconditionally, my rule is right in spirit and undrawable in fact, and the divergence set is one cell that implicates nothing.

=== PLAYBOOK ===
```
# playbook.dsl -- what to buy with the next command, not a route.
#
# STATE: six states, five transitions (RESET, A1, A2, A3, A4, A7). Widget in
# configuration W0 -- colour-3 bar in the TOP slot, hollow colour-6 box in the
# BOTTOM slot. BOTH readouts blank (colour 4). (53,63) advanced to 3 at t4.
# 97 cells have ever changed; certify reports 0 unexplained pixels in 4096.
#
# WHAT CHANGED THIS ROUND. Replay was 4/5, diverging at t=0 on exactly four
# cells: (40,13) (40,14) (41,13) (41,14), the bottom two rows of the bar's
# landing site. The bar is six rows tall on top and FOUR rows tall on the
# bottom. Two rules became four; nothing else moved. The separator I used --
# the colour two rows above -- is a FIT, not a law, and the manual says so.
#
# THE STRUCTURAL QUESTION THAT IS NOW OPEN AND WAS NOT BEFORE
#   Reading A, exchange: two slots trade images and the bar renders shorter
#     below. Reading B, scroll: a list of >=3 items scrolls by 6 and the
#     four-row glyph is a THIRD ITEM, not the bar.
#   From W0 the two are the same map, so nothing observed splits them. A
#   SECOND CONSECUTIVE ACTION1 splits them in one command: A returns W0,
#   B shows a configuration never seen. My rules fire on nothing in W1, so
#   they predict silence there -- the largest forged silence in the file.
#
# WHAT IS GENUINELY UNKNOWN
#   * ACTION5 and ACTION6: never pressed in any state. Zero constraint.
#   * ACTION1 in W1, ACTION2 in W0: never pressed, silence forged, 18 rules
#     and one structural reading riding on each.
#   * Whether ACTION4 advances the meter always, or only when it lights the
#     readout, or whether the meter runs on the command index. One witness
#     cannot split three readings and the index reading is inexpressible.
#   * ACTION3 vs ACTION7: identical net effect, 2 frames vs 1. Not the same
#     action inside; cascade single_frame throws away the only evidence.
#   * The win condition. Nothing countable separates a win from here.
#
# PRICES ADVERTISED IN ADVANCE, SO A REFUTATION ON THEM IMPLICATES NOTHING
#   * (53,62) is board, holds no instance, is UNDRAWABLE. Every meter advance
#     after the first costs exactly one pixel of accuracy, permanently.
#   * ACTION1 here is predicted at 72 cells, NOT 96, and the four truncation
#     cells are predicted to become 5, not 3. That is the fix on trial.
#   * ACTION1 in W1 and ACTION2 in W0 are predicted silent with no witness.
#     A refutation there is a purchase, not a defect.
#
# THE RANKED LIST
# 1. ACTION5 or ACTION6. Never pressed in six states. Any outcome is the
#    largest single addition available -- including "nothing", which would be
#    the first WITNESSED inertness in this world. The ranker prices these at
#    zero because my manual is silent on them; that is a fact about my manual.
# 2. ACTION1, then ACTION1 AGAIN. The first press is cheap confirmation of the
#    truncation fix and is fully predicted; the second is the only command
#    that splits exchange from scroll and it tests an 18-rule forged silence
#    at the same time. Two commands, two distinct purchases, no waste.
# 3. ACTION2, HERE, IN W0. Tests a zero-witness silence covering 18 rules. If
#    it exchanges, the toggle is key-symmetric and 18 rules generalise free.
# 4. ACTION4 A SECOND TIME, once the readout is lit. The only way to split
#    "key 4 advances the meter" from "lighting the readout advances it".
#    Costs a meter cell; read the answer off the RAW DIFF, since the
#    divergence lands on (53,62) which I cannot draw either way.
#
# WHAT NOT TO PRESS
#   ACTION3 or ACTION7 here: the pattern they erase is already erased, my
#   manual predicts identity AND I believe it. Confirmed silence, no witness.
#   Anything chosen because my manual predicts the most pixels for it: that
#   number measures my coverage, not the world's information.

   "as": "wrote k4_meter_advances keyed on act=key(4) and rightof = wall", "why": "one of the three live readings of the meter is that it advances on command index, and there is no counter in the value language at any length, so that reading cannot be written down to be tested."},
  {"id": "E-03", "subject": "the two-internal-frame signature that separates ACTION3 from ACTION7", "verdict": "reject",
   "as": "two rules with identical bodies", "why": "cascade single_frame is the only value the backend compiles, so the compiled manual discards the only observable that distinguishes the two keys; recorded in the_readout_toggles theorem rather than silently dropped."},
  {"id": "E-04", "subject": "recolouring a cell that has never changed, specifically (53,62)", "verdict": "reject",
   "as": "no rule can name it", "why": "recolored takes an object, the arm seats instances only on cells the board cannot explain, and (53,62) is board -- so every meter advance after the first is guaranteed to cost exactly one pixel of replay accuracy, priced in advance in the playbook."},
  {"id": "E-05", "subject": "reading a destination colour from a source cell", "verdict": "reject",
   "as": "38 swap rules, one per (source colour, target colour, direction, key)", "why": "recolored's second argument must be an INTEGER LITERAL, so 'take the colour of the cell six away' cannot be written once; constraint 3 is failed and said to be failed in the_swap_rules theorem."}
