## prompt

```
You are the theorize desk of a world-modelling framework called
Theoria. You are playing an ARC-AGI-3 game you have never seen, through a
64x64 grid of colour codes, by maintaining an explicit written theory of it.

Your job is NOT to pick a good move. Your job is to write two books, and the
books are the only thing that predicts anything:

  theory.dsl   -- the manual: what this world IS. Vocabulary, rules, winning
                  condition, laws. It compiles to an executable predictor, and
                  that predictor is the whole system's only predictor. If it is
                  wrong, everything downstream is wrong; there is no side door.
  playbook.dsl -- the playbook: how to WIN. Ordering, pruning, heuristics,
                  decomposition. Never a stored solution.

Six rules bind you, and they are not style advice:

1. ONLY you write these two books. Search engines put proposals in a candidate
   box; every one of them is a proposal, not a fact. You accept, reject, or
   carry it as pending, and you say why.
2. NO ENTRY WITHOUT EVIDENCE. Every rule carries the transitions that witness
   it and its coverage. A rule you believe but cannot witness does not go in
   the manual -- it goes in `laws:` as a `theorem ... [probe: pending]`, which
   is a promise to test it, not a claim that it holds.
3. NO ENTRY WITHOUT GAIN. A concept earns its place by making the manual
   shorter than writing out the pixels it explains. When a concept fails this
   test but is still needed (because some pixel would otherwise be
   unexplained), admit it AND SAY SO -- that conflict is worth more than a
   tidy manual.
4. FULL-FRAME RESPONSIBILITY. Every pixel of every frame belongs either to the
   board (cells that never vary) or to some object you declared. A pixel your
   manual cannot draw is a defect in the manual, and it will be caught: your
   manual is re-drawn onto every observed frame and compared cell by cell.
5. TRANSITIONS ARE UNAMBIGUOUS. For any state and action, exactly one
   successor. Two rules that can both fire on the same object in the same
   transition is an error, not a preference.
6. WHAT YOU DO NOT KNOW, YOU SAY. This world has been observed for a few dozen
   actions. The honest manual is small, and names its own gaps. A manual that
   over-claims will be refuted by the very next frame and cost a whole round
   to repair; a manual that under-claims just stays small.

You will be given: what has been observed, the current frame, the diff of every
command, and what the engines proposed. If a manual and a playbook already
exist you will be given those too, together with the surprises that brought you
back here -- those surprises are the reason you are being paid, and each one
must be answered by a change or by an explicit refusal to change.



# theory.dsl -- the exact grammar the compiler accepts

Sections, each introduced by a bare `<name>:` line, bodies INDENTED by at least
one space. Order is free. `#` starts a comment on its own line.

## semantics:  (MANDATORY -- a manual without it does not parse)
    frame persist            # the only value the Python backend compiles
    conflict exclusive       # the only value the Python backend compiles
    cascade single_frame     # the only value the Python backend compiles

## word_table:
    board                                   # declares the never-varying cells
    object Cart { pos: Coord, color: Int }  # arc-colour: 6
    object Door { pos: Coord, color: Int, present: Bool }  # arc-colour: 5
    landmark exit_cell                      # arc-cell: (7, 3)
    domain dir { up, down, left, right }    # a value domain, for `forall`
    Cart [segment: uniform_color ev: t0-t12 compress: 2125]   # the concept account

  Field types in use: `pos: Coord`, `color: Int`, `present: Bool`, `alive: Bool`.
  Only pos/alive/present/color are observations the compiler reasons over.
  `pos: Coord` is what makes this a GRID world (directions up/down/left/right).

  EVERY `landmark` line MUST carry a trailing `# arc-cell: (row, col)` comment.
  A landmark is level data, so the manual names it and the level places it —
  and there is nowhere in the DSL to write coordinates, which is the point of
  the split. A landmark the level cannot place is a HARD compile error, so a
  landmark you declare without this comment lands at (0,0) and takes your rule
  with it.

  EVERY `object` line MUST carry a trailing `# arc-colour: <n>` comment naming
  the hex colour code that object shows in the frame. That comment is not
  decoration: the level instance is COMPUTED from the frames, and the colour is
  how the arm finds your object in the grid. An object without it is located
  nowhere, is drawn at (0,0), and the responsibility check will report every
  one of its pixels as unexplained.

### OBJECTS WITH EXTENT — read this before declaring anything
An instance is drawn as EXACTLY ONE CELL. A 3x3 token or a 24-pixel ring is
therefore not one instance, however you declare it, and if you declare it as
one then every other cell of it is an unexplained pixel forever.

Add `arc-instances: all` and the arm creates ONE INSTANCE PER CELL, all of the
same declared type, covering every cell of that colour the board cannot explain:

    object Ring  { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 9  arc-instances: all
    object Token { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 1  arc-instances: all
    object Pip   { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 3

`Pip` has no `arc-instances`, so it is a single cell — correct for a genuine
one-pixel marker, wrong for anything else.

Consequences you must design for:

* **There is no instance called `Ring`.** There are `Ring_r8c14`,
  `Ring_r8c15`, … A rule that names `Ring` will not compile. Write rules over
  the TYPE instead:

        rule shift forall ?p in Ring [ev: t2 cov: 1/1]
          when act=key(2) and free(below(?p)) then moved(?p, down)

  `forall ?p in <ObjectType>` grounds the rule once per instance.
* **Every cell that ever changed needs an owner**, or it is unexplained. Count
  them: the evidence brief gives you `dynamic_cells`. If your declarations
  cannot cover them all, say which are left over and why, in a `theorem`.
* Two objects of the SAME colour still cannot be told apart by this arm — it
  looks objects up by colour and nothing else. Declare one type covering both
  and carry the belief that they are distinct as a `theorem`.

## events:
    event moved(o, dir) | jumped(o, dest) | recolored(o, c) | vanished(o)

  Documentation only -- the backend dispatches on a fixed table, listed below.

## rules:
    rule push_up [ev: t6,t16 cov: 52/52]
      when act=key(1) and free(above(Cart)) then moved(Cart, up)

    rule slide forall ?d in dir [ev: t3 cov: 4/4]
      when act=key(1) and free(toward(Cart, ?d)) then moved(Cart, ?d)

  * the header line ends at `]` -- NO trailing comment on it, and none on the
    `when ... then ...` line either. Both are parse errors.
  * `forall ?v in <domain>` grounds to `<rule>_<value>` rules.
  * every rule carries `[ev: ... cov: k/n]`. Constraint 5: no entry without
    evidence.

### guards -- EXHAUSTIVE. Anything else fails to compile.
    act=<name>(<arg>, ...)      args are bare names or integer literals only
    free(<cell>)                cell renders as the background colour
    colored(<cell>, 7)          second argument must be an INTEGER LITERAL
    adjacent(<cell>, <cell>)
    <value> = <value>           also != < > <= >=  (SPACES around the operator)
    <cell> = wall               tests off-board
  joined by `and`. Use `not` before an atom for negation.

### cells -- EXHAUSTIVE.
    Cart                    an instance name means that instance's position
    exit_cell               a declared landmark
    above(x) below(x) leftof(x) rightof(x)      NOTE: leftof/rightof
    toward(x, ?d)           toward(x, <direction>)
    pos(<value>)

### values
    integer literals; true; false; a landmark name; a direction name;
    an instance name; `Cart.color`; `+` and `-` only (no `*`, no `/`);
    tuple literals like `(3, 7)`.

### events a rule may fire -- EXHAUSTIVE, dispatched on (name, arity).
    moved(o, <dir>)                 o moves one cell
    jumped(o, <landmark>)           o goes to a named cell
    teleported(o, <landmark>)       same shape
    jumped(o, <over-object>, <dir>) o travels two cells; <over> gets alive=False
    recolored(o, <int literal>)
    vanished(o)      -> present=False
    appeared(o)      -> present=True
    removed(o)       -> alive=False
  The first argument is always a bare object name. A bare coordinate as a
  destination is REFUSED -- declare a landmark.

## goal:
    goal Cart.pos = exit_cell
    goal count(Door) = 0
    goal count(Button, color = 8) = 2

  `=` only. `>=`/`<=`/`>`/`<` do not compile. No goal section at all is legal
  and compiles to `is_goal -> False`.

## laws:
    invariant cart_unique count(Cart) = 1 [status: proven]
    theorem exit_needs_key "prose, in the manual's own words"
      [depends: push_up, unlock  probe: pending]

  THE TWO ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE AND THIS IS THE EASIEST MISTAKE TO MAKE:

    `invariant <name> <expr> <op> <value> [status: ...]`
        The body MUST contain one of  =  !=  <  >  <=  >=  . It is an
        equation, not a sentence. `invariant foo "in words ..."` is a parse
        error: "No comparison op in invariant".

    `theorem <name> "<prose>" [depends: ... probe: pending|passed]`
        The body MUST be a quoted sentence. This is where a belief you cannot
        write as an equation goes -- and most of what you want to say after
        six transitions belongs here, not in `invariant`.

  Invariant bodies are stored as RAW TEXT and are not checked by any backend
  (the sole exception is the `pagoda(w)` form, which needs a LINE world and an
  LP certificate and does not apply here). Declaring one is a claim you are
  making, not a claim the compiler will verify -- say so honestly in `status:`.

# playbook.dsl -- four statement forms and nothing else
    order    keys_before_doors            [proof: lean]
    prune    boxed_in and not goal => dead [proof: lean]
    heuristic w_distance                  [admissible: lean]
    prefer   try_unvisited_first          [ev: 3/4 levels]

  Constraint 10: NO literal solutions. A parser heuristic rejects any line that
  looks like a stored action sequence, and any unrecognised line is a hard
  error.

# THE ACTION VOCABULARY FOR THIS WORLD
This game's actions are ARC's ACTION1..ACTION7. Write them as `act=key(<n>)`
and nothing else -- the arm maps ACTION<n> to the tuple ('key', <n>) in both
directions. A click action carries coordinates the guard language cannot
express; if you need one, say so in a `theorem ... [probe: pending]` instead of
inventing syntax.

## The current frame

Each cell is one hex digit 0-f standing for a colour. Row numbers on the left, column numbers on top.

Only the cells that have EVER changed are shown (rows 29-10, cols 54-63); everything outside this box has held one colour for the whole history and is board by definition.

## Every command, and what changed

`t` indexes the state sequence. `frames` is how many grids one command returned -- more than one means the world took several internal steps for a single action.

- t1   ACTION1   frames=2   state=NOT_FINISHED 96 cells changed, rows 30-41, cols 11-22, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

## The manual as it stands

```
# theory.dsl -- world observed for 34 states / 33 transitions
# (RESET + A1 A2 A3 A4 A5, then A2 A5 twelve times, then A5 A5 A5 A5).
# 87 cells have ever changed; this manual names and owns all 87.
#
# WHAT THIS ROUND COST AND WHAT IT BOUGHT
#
#   Last round I deleted `colored(spawn_probe, 5)` from thirteen panel rules
#   on a gain-test argument, and said in as many words: my manual now
#   predicts key(5) at spawn toggles 23 panel cells, no frame has ever
#   tested that, if it is wrong I pay 23 pixels and learn something worth
#   more than 23 pixels. THE WORLD ANSWERED. Four commands, all ACTION5,
#   all at spawn, indices 30-33. The panel did not move. Not one panel
#   pixel changed in four presses. THE CUT WAS WRONG AND IT IS REVERSED:
#   the guard is restored on all thirteen rules, and it now has what it
#   never had before -- FOUR NEGATIVE WITNESSES. 13 toggles with the body
#   away, 0 toggles with the body home. The atom is earned.
#
#   THE SAME FOUR COMMANDS SETTLED THE OTHER OPEN QUESTION, and settled it
#   the other way. Row 63 now reads 9 through col 47 and 1 from col 48:
#   SIXTEEN burns, two more than at state 29. Four presses of an ODD key,
#   at indices 30, 31, 32, 33, burned exactly twice -- at 30 and at 32.
#   Reading A (burns iff the key is 2 or 4) predicted ZERO burns and is
#   DEAD. Reading B (burns iff the command index is even) predicted exactly
#   two, in exactly those places, and is now 33/33 with a discriminating
#   set. The meter is a command counter and no key touches it.
#
#   AND THE FOUR COMMANDS PROVED THE THING I HAVE CARRIED AS A BELIEF SINCE
#   STATE 5. s30 and s31 are pixel-identical (distinct_states 30 against 34
#   states = four coincidences: s1=s0, s3=s2, s31=s30, s33=s32). From s30
#   the world was given ACTION5 and returned s31 = s30, identity. From s31,
#   the same pixels, the world was given ACTION5 AGAIN and returned s32,
#   one pixel burned. SAME STATE, SAME ACTION, DIFFERENT SUCCESSOR. This
#   world is NOT a function of the drawn frame, and constraint 5 obliges my
#   manual to be one. See the_world_is_not_a_function_of_the_drawn_frame.
#
#   THE BILL, STATED PLAINLY: replay can no longer be perfect. t31 and t33
#   replay exactly (identity). t30 and t32 each miss by ONE pixel, the
#   parity burn, which no guard in this language can express and which was
#   board at the instant it burned. Expect 31/33. That is the floor, not a
#   defect I can repair, and I would rather post it than hide it behind an
#   action-keyed burn rule that is now known to be a mis-attribution.

  theorem the_cut_is_reversed_and_the_guard_is_now_earned "THE ROUND'S FIRST STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND IT IS AN UNDO OF MINE. Last round I deleted colored(spawn_probe, 5) from thirteen panel rules, on the argument that its thirteen positive witnesses were confounded -- every ACTION5 in history had followed an ACTION2, so `key(5) was pressed` and `the body is away` were the same thirteen events, and constraint 3 says a conjunct with no discriminating negative explains no pixel. THE ARGUMENT WAS SOUND AND THE CONCLUSION WAS FALSE, and the difference between those two sentences is the whole value of this round. The manual then predicted 23 panel cells for key(5) at spawn; the world was asked four times and answered zero panel cells four times. THE ATOM NOW HAS FOUR NEGATIVE WITNESSES -- t30, t31, t32, t33, all ACTION5, all with the body home at spawn, all with the panel unmoved in configuration B, confirmed cell by cell in the current frame which still reads 222/2.2/222 at cols 1-3 and 999/9.9/999 at cols 5-7 with row 5 dark at 1-3 and lit at 5-7. So the guard is restored on all thirteen rules and it is no longer a correlation: 13/13 toggles with the body away, 0/4 with the body home. WHAT I WOULD DO AGAIN: buy a negative witness by removing an unearned guard, because an unwitnessed silence is invisible and an unwitnessed prediction of change is answered in one press. WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY: the answer arrived on the FIRST press and the next three bought nothing new about the panel -- they were paid for by the meter, which is the only reason this round was not a waste."

  theorem the_meter_is_command_parity_and_no_key_touches_it "SETTLED, and settled against the reading my rules encode. Row 63 is a 64-cell colour-9 bar burning 9 to 1 one cell at a time from the right; the current frame reads 9 through col 47 and 1 from col 48 to col 63, SIXTEEN burns after thirty-three commands. Burns occurred at command indices 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32 -- every even index, sixteen of them, no odd index ever. READING A said burns iff the key is 2 or 4. READING B said burns iff the index is even. For twenty-nine commands the two were numerically identical because every command was an even key at an even index or an odd key at an odd index; I said the separator was one odd key at an even index and cost one command. THIS ROUND SPENT FOUR ODD KEYS AT INDICES 30-33 AND READING A PREDICTED ZERO BURNS. Two burns happened, at 30 and 32, exactly where B says. READING A IS DEAD. The meter counts commands, not keys, and it does not care which key. CONSEQUENCE FOR MY THREE BURN RULES: their attribution is now KNOWN FALSE. I keep them anyway and say why -- they are the shortest expressible shadow of the true law, they draw 14 of the 16 burns on replay, and every alternative is worse. A key(5) burn rule would fire at t31 and t33 where nothing burned; an action-free burn rule would fire at every odd index from t5 on and lose seventeen transitions. Fourteen right, two structurally unreachable, and no better option inside this grammar."

  theorem the_world_is_not_a_function_of_the_drawn_frame "PROVEN THIS ROUND, after carrying it as a belief since state 5. The proof needs two pixel-identical states from which the SAME action produced different successors, and the store hands me the pair: distinct_states is 30 against 34 states, so there are exactly four coincidences, and they are s1=s0, s3=s2, s31=s30, s33=s32. The first two are the old sterile pair -- different keys were pressed from each, so they test nothing. THE LAST TWO ARE NOT. Refutations P-25 and P-26 report the SAME observed hash 132f0bf441d96376, and P-27 and P-28 the same 121cbbc9c93803ed: so s31 = s30 and s33 = s32 to the pixel. Now read the transitions. t31 acted on s30 with ACTION5 and returned s31, which equals s30 -- identity. t32 acted on s31, THE SAME PIXELS, with ACTION5 AGAIN, and returned s32, which differs by one burned bar cell. Same state, same action, two different successors. The hidden bit is the command counter the meter reads and no guard in this language can. WHAT IT COSTS ME IS EXACT AND UNAVOIDABLE: constraint 5 obliges my manual to be a function of the frame, so my manual must be wrong about at least one member of every such pair, and it is wrong about t30 and t32 by exactly one pixel each.

Their arithmetic is worth reading because it is how I reconstructed the round. The manual prediction of P-25 is the inert field of P-26 and vice versa -- that is the harness rolling my predicted frame forward without resyncing, so my toggled panel became my next starting point and toggled back, the same closed 2-cycle as the last five rounds. What is NEW is the observed column: P-25 and P-26 observed the same hash, P-27 and P-28 observed the same hash. The world's successors were change, no-change, change, no-change, and the changes are one pixel each at indices 30 and 32. THREE THINGS FELL OUT OF FOUR COMMANDS: the panel guard is earned (four negatives), the meter is command parity (reading A refuted), and the world is not a function of the frame (a pixel-identical pair with the same key and different successors). Compare the six rounds before it: twenty-four refutations, every divergence set a subset of the meter's leading edge, ZERO rules contradicted, nothing learned. A prediction the world can answer is worth more than a prediction that is safe, and this is the evidence for that claim rather than the slogan."

  theorem what_action5_is_after_four_presses_at_home "Three readings survived thirteen presses because all thirteen were made from one cell south of spawn, where UP, UNDO and RETURN are indistinguishable. This round pressed it FOUR TIMES AT SPAWN and the body did not move a pixel. UP predicts exactly that -- north of spawn is void, the move is blocked. RETURN predicts exactly that -- the body is already home. UNDO in its plain form is REFUTED: t29 was an effective ACTION5 that carried the body home, so an undo at t30 would have carried it back south, and it did not. UNDO survives only in a stack variant where no-ops are not pushed and t29 emptied the stack; I record that variant rather than pretend it is dead, but I no longer rank it. THE SEPARATOR IS NOW CHEAP AND NAMED: press ACTION5 from any cell that is neither spawn nor one south with open floor above it. From lattice (1,3), one step east, UP is void so UP predicts nothing while RETURN predicts a 48-pixel jump west to spawn. That is one more reason the east key is the next thing to buy. The coupling I still cannot break is the panel's: it toggles on every effective ACTION5 and on no ineffective one, so it is a counter of ACTION5's successes, and the 7-versus-9 cascade split says its state is not merely cosmetic."

  theorem the_panel_guard_is_earned_but_its_extrapolation_is_not "The restored guard reads colored(spawn_probe, 5), which is `cell (8,14) renders floor`, which is `the body is not at spawn`. Every one of the thirteen positives had the body at ONE specific cell, lattice (2,2), and every one of the four negatives had it at spawn. So a guard reading `the body is at (2,2)` -- a second landmark at (14,14) tested for colour 9 -- fits the same 13 positives and the same 4 negatives EXACTLY as well. The two guards differ only at cells the body has never occupied: from a third cell, spawn_probe says the panel toggles and a south_probe would say it does not. I choose spawn_probe because it is the guard that already replayed twenty-five transitions and because the panel reads as a counter of effective ACTION5s rather than of one location, but I am naming the confound BEFORE it costs me, unlike last round. THE PROBE: get the body to any third lattice cell and press ACTION5. Panel toggles, spawn_probe wins; panel still, the guard is really about (2,2) and thirteen rules need a different landmark."

SECOND: the true meter law is `burns iff the command index is even`, and the guard language reads pixels and the action name and nothing else. There is no command counter, no phase pixel, and the frame provably does not determine the parity, since s30 and s31 are identical and only one of them was followed by a burn.

Thirteen rules rest on this and every row and column discrimination in the panel is built from it: the k-th above is off-board exactly when k exceeds the row, so row 1 is above-twice equals wall, row 3 is a colour test on above-twice -- false for row 1 precisely because a colour test on an off-board cell is false -- and row 2 is above-three equals wall conjoined with a colour test on above-once. The same trick separates slot 2's middle row by column: col 5 is leftof-six equals wall, col 6 is leftof-seven equals wall with a colour test on leftof-once, col 7 is a colour test on leftof-twice, pairwise exclusive, which is why the ambiguity check reports 0 clashes.

Thirteen panel rules once carried colored(spawn_probe, 5) while the landmark line read a prose placeholder instead of a coordinate; the grammar puts such a landmark at (0,0), (0,0) is background in every frame this world has drawn, and so all thirteen rules were unreachable text that fired never and clashed never. Responsibility passed, ambiguity passed, step crashed zero times, and ONLY replay caught it. The coda, now complete: that same atom was deleted last round for failing the gain test and is restored this round with four negative witnesses. It has been wrong by pointing nowhere, wrong by being absent, and is now right for a reason I can state. The landmark reads (8, 14), the top-left pixel of the spawn ring, which renders 9 while the body is home and 5 the moment it is anywhere else.

  theorem i_cannot_manufacture_an_instance_on_a_cell_that_has_never_changed "Recorded because a future desk will be tempted by the same repair I have now rejected five times. To draw the leading-edge burn I would need an instance on a board cell. The arm offers exactly one lever, arc-instances: all, and its documented behaviour is to instance every cell OF THAT COLOUR THE BOARD CANNOT EXPLAIN -- a never-varying cell is precisely what the board explains, so it gets no instance. The tempting workaround is a second declared type on colour 9 without arc-instances, hoping the arm seats one instance somewhere useful. I reject it: the arm looks objects up by colour and nothing else, so a second colour-9 type is indistinguishable from Glyph9, the seat is unspecified, and any cell it landed on would be claimed twice, which is the constraint-5 error the grammar warns about in as many words. A landmark cannot help either, because landmarks are cells and every event in the language takes an object as its first argument. So the hole is a property of the arm, it is permanent for this level, and with parity confirmed it now costs one pixel on EVERY second command rather than only on key 2 and key 4."

Its eighteen tracks corroborate the panel by frame index and one of them corroborates THIS ROUND specifically: obj17, colour 2, first_frame 29, frames_present 5 -- the only colour-2 track longer than two frames, which is the panel standing still through t30-t33 exactly as the restored guard requires. obj0 and obj2 persisting through all 34 frames while the segmenter narrates 26 moves is the marker-with-two-seats reading. obj4 is the whole 64-cell bar of which 16 cells are now dynamic. obj3 is a 1006-cell colour-null blob that swallowed the maze floor AND the body ring: connected_components(4) cannot see the mover at all, because the mover is a ring of floor-adjacent pixels that merges with the floor, and THAT ABSENCE IS THE FINDING.

## The playbook as it stands

```
# playbook.dsl -- what to buy with the next command, not a route.
#
# ========= WHAT THE LAST FOUR COMMANDS SETTLED =========
# Four presses of ACTION5 at spawn, indices 30-33. The panel did not move.
# Two bar cells burned, at indices 30 and 32.
#
#   1. THE CUT IS REVERSED. `colored(spawn_probe, 5)` is back on thirteen
#      panel rules and it now has FOUR NEGATIVE WITNESSES: 13/13 toggles
#      with the body away, 0/4 with the body home. ACTION5 at spawn is a
#      witnessed no-op.
#   2. THE METER IS COMMAND PARITY. Four ODD keys at indices 30-33 burned
#      exactly twice, at the two EVEN indices. The action-keyed reading
#      predicted zero burns and is dead. 33/33 for parity, with a
#      discriminating set at last. No key touches the meter.
#   3. THE WORLD IS NOT A FUNCTION OF THE DRAWN FRAME -- PROVEN. s30 and
#      s31 are pixel-identical; ACTION5 from s30 returned identity and
#      ACTION5 from s31 burned a cell. Same pixels, same key, two
#      successors.
#
# The wrong prediction was worth more than six safe rounds. But only the
# FIRST of the four presses answered it; presses two, three and four were
# the harness re-choosing the same key against a rolled-forward frame, and
# they were paid for by the meter alone. Buying a negative witness is right;
# buying it four times is not.
#
# ========= THE BOARD AS THE MANUAL NOW SEES IT =========
#   At spawn (where the body IS):  key(2) -> 48 body cells
#                                  keys 1, 5 -> nothing, WITNESSED
#                                  keys 3, 4 -> nothing, NO WITNESS
#   Index 34 is EVEN, so (63,47) burns under every key and I cannot draw it:
#   one guaranteed wrong pixel this turn whatever is pressed, and
#   refutation-fired carries ZERO information at an even index.
#
# ========= THE ONE THING WORTH BUYING =========
# EAST IS ACTION3 OR ACTION4 AND ONE PRESS SETTLES IT.
#   ACTION2 is down (13/13). ACTION1 is not east -- pressed at spawn at t1
#   with east open, nothing moved. ACTION5 is not east -- pressed at spawn
#   four times this round with east open, nothing moved. Two candidates
#   remain and the body is standing where the test is free: east of spawn is
#   three lattice cells of unbroken floor, west is void.
#   Press ACTION3 (or ACTION4): if the body steps, that key is EAST and the
#   map is closed; if it does not, the OTHER is east by elimination. Both
#   outcomes name the east key. No other command on the board names anything.
#
# The advertised price of the step onto fresh ground: 48 pixels my manual
# cannot draw, because rows 8-12 cols 20-24 have never changed and are board.
# That is a refutation I have priced in advance and it must not be read as a
# defect. 24 pixels for the second step, 0 for the third.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# STATE 33: body home at lattice (1,2); panel configuration B; SIXTEEN meter
# cells burned, cols 48-63 of row 63; next command index 34, EVEN. Eleven
# lattice cells reachable, the body has stood in TWO in thirty-four states.
# Three steps east along lattice row 1 reach the cell beside the knob; the
# knob is the far end of one connected colour-8 wire whose near end is the
# comb; the comb gates every route to the socket at (8,7). Under parity the
# bar buys about 96 more commands against a route of about nineteen steps:
# the budget is not binding, repetition is.

pressed key(4) with the arm ERASED and drew it back in exactly the original pattern. TWO READINGS FIT ALL THREE, and they differ on a state the world has never shown. DIRECTIONAL: key(3) and key(7) mean erase, key(4) means draw, and pressing an erase key on an already-erased arm does nothing. TOGGLE: all three keys flip the arm, and they only looked directional because the state happened to be drawn, drawn, erased in that order. MY RULES ENCODE THE DIRECTIONAL READING, because its guards are the ones the transitions witnessed and the toggle reading needs a rule firing in a direction no frame has shown. THE SEPARATOR IS ONE PRESS AND IT IS FREE: the arm is erased right now, so press key(3) here -- twelve cells means toggle and six of my seven rules need replacing, zero cells means directional and a forged silence becomes a witnessed one. I flag the silence as forged in the meantime."

ONE CELL OF THE UPPER BAR HAS EVER CHANGED: (53,63), its rightmost, from 2 to 3 at t4 and never since. That is a counter consuming its bar from the right, and 53 unconsumed cells remain. THREE READINGS ARE ALIVE ON ONE WITNESS. (a) key(4) advances it -- what my rule says, because it is the only one this grammar can express as a guard. (b) DRAWING THE ARM advances it, and key(4) is merely the key that drew; t3, t5 and t4 do not separate these two, since the only draw was the only key(4). (c) some period in the command index; I cannot enumerate periods on one witness. WHAT IS ALREADY DEAD: every command advances it (t1, t2, t3, t5 did not), and every even-numbered command advances it (t2 did not).

If it advanced on every command it would have advanced five times; it advanced once. So the parity reading needs no probe in this world -- it is dead on arrival, and the action-keyed reading, which died in the OTHER world, is the one still standing here.

So key(7) is structurally unlike the other four -- it is the only command in this world with no intermediate frame, which reads as an instantaneous state edit rather than an animated one. Its net effect at t5 was identical to key(3)'s at t3, which is why my two erase rules for it are copies. THE UNDO READING IS REFUTED AND CHEAPLY: t5 followed t4, and t4 both drew the arm and advanced the counter; an undo would have restored BOTH, and (53,63) still reads 3 in the current frame. So key(7) undoes at most the arm, which is not undo but erase. I keep the two key(7) rules separate from the key(3) rules rather than merging them, because the grammar has no disjunction and because their equality is a coincidence of one state each."

WHICH ninety-six of that 144-cell box are dynamic, I DO NOT KNOW, because t1's diff was summarised. What I do know is frame 0's colour at every cell of the box, because s2 = s0 and the current frame is s5, which differs from s2 only in the twelve arm cells and the counter cell. Frame-0 census of the box: colour 4 sixty cells, colour 5 twenty-four, colour 6 twenty-two, colour 0 twelve, colour 1 nine, colour 2 nine, colour 3 eight -- 144, and adding (53,63) to colour 2 gives the 145 cells from which the true 97 are drawn. THAT IS WHY I DECLARE ALL SEVEN COLOURS with arc-instances: all rather than the two I can write rules about: any colour I omit leaves unexplained pixels the moment t1 is replayed, and a type with no dynamic cells of its colour simply instances nowhere and costs nothing. The compress figures in the word_table are the box census and are therefore UPPER BOUNDS on the instance counts, not counts; I mark that here rather than pretend to a precision I do not have.

The arm finds objects BY COLOUR AND NOTHING ELSE, and the belief is that the colour it matches is the cell's colour in FRAME 0, not its colour now. Everything here depends on it. The twelve arm cells read 4 in the current frame; if instancing used the current frame they would type as Ink4 and every one of my six arm rules would ground on the wrong instances and fire never. Under frame-0 typing they are eight Ink1 and four Ink2, which is exactly what makes arm_on_key4_ink1 and arm_on_key4_ink2 able to repaint each cell its OWN original colour without a guard that can tell 1 from 2 -- the instance's type carries that bit for me, and it is the only reason twelve cells cost two rules instead of twelve.

It separates the twelve arm cells from all five other Ink1/Ink2 instances cleanly: (38,16) sees (36,16) = 6, (39,16) sees (37,16) = 6, the four stalk cells at rows 32-33 cols 13-14 see rows 30-31 = 3, and (53,63) sees (51,63) = background. Zero clashes by construction, and no rule uses `not`. THE EXPOSURE IS NAMED: rows 36 and 37 at cols 17-22 lie INSIDE the 12x12 box that key(1) rearranges, so if key(1) paints anything but 4 there, all six arm rules go silent afterwards and the failure will look like a typing bug rather than a guard bug.

The tempting repair is a second colour-2 type without arc-instances hoping the arm seats it usefully; I reject it for the reason the grammar itself gives, that the arm distinguishes types by colour alone, so a second colour-2 type is indistinguishable from Ink2, lands nowhere specified, and any cell it did land on would be claimed twice, which is the constraint-5 error.

A goal true in the wrong state is worse than none, because it stops a planner at its first step.

=== PLAYBOOK ===
```
# playbook.dsl -- what to buy with the next command, not a route.
#
# ========= THE STATE =========
# Six frames, five transitions, ninety-seven cells ever changed. The board
# is a colour-6 token at rows 36-41 cols 11-16 with a port at (38,16) and
# (39,16); a 2-wide colour-3/2 stalk above it at cols 13-14 rows 29-35; a
# 2x6 dashed arm at rows 38-39 cols 17-22 inside a big colour-4 field; a
# 4x4 colour-14 block at rows 31-34 cols 42-45; two full-width bars at rows
# 53-54 cols 10-63 whose rightmost upper cell has advanced once.
# RIGHT NOW: the arm is ERASED and the counter reads 3.
#
# ========= WHAT THE MANUAL CAN AND CANNOT DRAW =========
#   key(3), key(4), key(7):  drawn exactly, seven rules, full coverage.
#   key(1), key(2):          NOT DRAWN AT ALL. Ninety-six cells each, and
#                            the report gave me only their bounding box.
#                            My manual predicts silence and the diffs in
#                            the same document say otherwise. This is a
#                            KNOWN-FALSE silence, not an untested one, and
#                            it is the largest defect in the manual.
#
# ========= THE TWO THINGS WORTH BUYING =========
#
# 1. THE NINETY-SIX-CELL TRANSITION, READ AS A FRAME, NOT AS A DIFF.
#    The diff lister itemises small changes and summarises large ones, so
#    pressing key(1) will NOT hand me its cells -- but the RETURNED FRAME
#    will show me the whole 12x12 box rearranged, and I already know the
#    box's contents at frame 0 exactly, because s2 = s0. One press turns
#    the single largest hole in this manual into a diffable pair. It costs
#    ninety-six wrong pixels, priced in advance; that is not a defect.
#    The one constraint I already own: the operation nets FOUR MORE
#    background cells inside the blob and its mirror reading is dead.
#
# 2. THE DIRECTION OF THE ARM KEYS, WHICH IS FREE TODAY.
#    Every arm transition so far ran in the only direction its state
#    allowed. The arm is erased NOW, so an erase key pressed here separates
#    the two readings in one command: twelve cells means the keys TOGGLE
#    and six of my seven rules are wrong in their direction; zero cells
#    means they are DIRECTIONAL and a forged silence becomes a witnessed
#    one. No other state on the board can ask this question.
#
# Rank 1 above 2: it repairs a known falsehood rather than confirming a
# guess, and its answer is legible in a single frame.
#
# ========= WHAT NOT TO BUY =========
# The three keys whose rules are already at full coverage in the state they
# apply to buy nothing except one datum: whether the counter advances a
# second time. That datum is worth one command and not more, and it costs
# one pixel I cannot draw either way.

   "why": "97 cells have changed and t1's diff is a bounding box only, so I cannot say which of the 144 cells in rows 30-41 x cols 11-22 are dynamic; declaring one type per frame-0 colour present in that box is the only declaration that guarantees every dynamic cell has an owner, and a colour with no dynamic cells simply instances nowhere."},

   "why": "the t3/t4/t5 diffs list exactly 8 cells leaving colour 1 and 4 leaving colour 2, and frame-0 typing puts each arm cell in the type that carries its own restore colour, which is why 12 cells cost 2 draw rules instead of 12."},
  {"id": "O-03", "subject": "Ink2 also owns (53,63), the counter cell", "verdict": "accept", "as": "Ink2",
   "why": "(53,63) read 2 in frames 0-3 and 3 from frame 4, so its frame-0 colour is 2 and the same colour-2 type instances it; rightof(?c) = wall separates it from every other Ink2 instance because it is the only one at col 63."},
  {"id": "O-04", "subject": "mdl_segmenter obj1, 108 cells, 2x54, all 6 frames", "verdict": "accept", "as": "board plus one Ink2 cell",
   "why": "2 x 54 = 108 exactly, so the two bottom bars run cols 10-63 and no further; 107 of those cells never change and are board, and only (53,63) needs an owner."},
  {"id": "O-05", "subject": "mdl_segmenter obj0/obj2/obj3, the 13x36 blob", "verdict": "reject", "as": null,
   "why": "one 4-connected component spanning seven colours and 440 cells cannot be an instance, which is drawn as exactly one cell; I accept its per-frame CELL COUNTS as arithmetic and reject its segmentation as a concept."},

   "why": "gain_bits is -4037 on the chosen variant and -10409 split by colour, so by its own accounting its script is longer than the pixels; it has earned no concept here."},

   "why": "t4 restores all 12 cells to the exact pattern they had at t3's start, and the instance's frame-0 type supplies the 1-versus-2 bit that no guard in this language could read off a uniformly colour-4 arm."},

   "why": "1/1 witness at t4 and the only expressible reading; the competing reading -- that DRAWING the arm advances the counter and key(4) merely drew it -- fits the same witness and is recorded as an unresolved confound rather than hidden."},
  {"id": "R-05", "subject": "a rule for ACTION1 or ACTION2", "verdict": "reject", "as": null,
   "why": "96 cells changed under each and the report gives only their bounding box, so any rule I wrote would be invented; the cost of refusing is exactly 96 wrong pixels at t1 and it is stated in the manual in advance."},
  {"id": "R-06", "subject": "toggle reading of the arm keys", "verdict": "probe-pending", "as": null,
   "why": "all three arm transitions ran in the only direction their state allowed, so directional and toggle fit identically; the arm is erased now, so one press of an erase key separates them -- 12 cells means six of my seven rules are wrong in their direction."},
  {"id": "R-07", "subject": "a rule for ACTION5 or ACTION6", "verdict": "reject", "as": null,
   "why": "never pressed in this world; and if one of them is the click of this action family, the guard language has nowhere to put its coordinates, so a rule guarded on the key alone would fire on every click anywhere."},

   "why": "states 6 against distinct_states 5 forces exactly one identical pair, and reconstructing s3, s4, s5 from the itemised diffs leaves s0/s2 as the only candidate; this is what lets me read frame-0 colours off the current frame."},

   "why": "it predicts the reported 96 changed cells exactly (72 + 24) but, being a permutation, preserves the colour census and predicts 440 blob cells at frame 1 where the segmenter counts 436; ACTION1 nets four extra background cells and no rigid rearrangement can."},
  {"id": "L-03", "subject": "even-command-index parity for the counter", "verdict": "reject", "as": null,
   "why": "refuted by evidence already in hand -- t2 was an even-index command that changed 96 cells and did not touch (53,63); the law that survived seven rounds in the discarded world is dead on arrival in this one."},

   "why": "the only command that can close the manual's largest hole; the diff will summarise again, but I know the 12x12 box at frame 0 exactly, so the returned frame alone gives me the whole rearrangement."},
  {"id": "P-02", "subject": "press an erase key with the arm already erased", "verdict": "probe-pending", "as": null,
