## prompt

```
You are the theorize desk of a world-modelling framework called
Theoria. You are playing an ARC-AGI-3 game you have never seen, through a
64x64 grid of colour codes, by maintaining an explicit written theory of it.

Your job is NOT to pick a good move. Your job is to write two books, and the
books are the only thing that predicts anything:

  theory.dsl   -- the manual: what this world IS. Vocabulary, rules, winning
                  condition, laws. It compiles to an executable predictor, and
                  that predictor is the whole system's only predictor. If it is
                  wrong, everything downstream is wrong; there is no side door.
  playbook.dsl -- the playbook: how to WIN. Ordering, pruning, heuristics,
                  decomposition. Never a stored solution.

Six rules bind you, and they are not style advice:

1. ONLY you write these two books. Search engines put proposals in a candidate
   box; every one of them is a proposal, not a fact. You accept, reject, or
   carry it as pending, and you say why.
2. NO ENTRY WITHOUT EVIDENCE. Every rule carries the transitions that witness
   it and its coverage. A rule you believe but cannot witness does not go in
   the manual -- it goes in `laws:` as a `theorem ... [probe: pending]`, which
   is a promise to test it, not a claim that it holds.
3. NO ENTRY WITHOUT GAIN. A concept earns its place by making the manual
   shorter than writing out the pixels it explains. When a concept fails this
   test but is still needed (because some pixel would otherwise be
   unexplained), admit it AND SAY SO -- that conflict is worth more than a
   tidy manual.
4. FULL-FRAME RESPONSIBILITY. Every pixel of every frame belongs either to the
   board (cells that never vary) or to some object you declared. A pixel your
   manual cannot draw is a defect in the manual, and it will be caught: your
   manual is re-drawn onto every observed frame and compared cell by cell.
5. TRANSITIONS ARE UNAMBIGUOUS. For any state and action, exactly one
   successor. Two rules that can both fire on the same object in the same
   transition is an error, not a preference.
6. WHAT YOU DO NOT KNOW, YOU SAY. This world has been observed for a few dozen
   actions. The honest manual is small, and names its own gaps. A manual that
   over-claims will be refuted by the very next frame and cost a whole round
   to repair; a manual that under-claims just stays small.

You will be given: what has been observed, the current frame, the diff of every
command, and what the engines proposed. If a manual and a playbook already
exist you will be given those too, together with the surprises that brought you
back here -- those surprises are the reason you are being paid, and each one
must be answered by a change or by an explicit refusal to change.



# theory.dsl -- the exact grammar the compiler accepts

Sections, each introduced by a bare `<name>:` line, bodies INDENTED by at least
one space. Order is free. `#` starts a comment on its own line.

## semantics:  (MANDATORY -- a manual without it does not parse)
    frame persist            # the only value the Python backend compiles
    conflict exclusive       # the only value the Python backend compiles
    cascade single_frame     # the only value the Python backend compiles

## word_table:
    board                                   # declares the never-varying cells
    object Cart { pos: Coord, color: Int }  # arc-colour: 6
    object Door { pos: Coord, color: Int, present: Bool }  # arc-colour: 5
    landmark exit_cell                      # arc-cell: (7, 3)
    domain dir { up, down, left, right }    # a value domain, for `forall`
    Cart [segment: uniform_color ev: t0-t12 compress: 2125]   # the concept account

  Field types in use: `pos: Coord`, `color: Int`, `present: Bool`, `alive: Bool`.
  Only pos/alive/present/color are observations the compiler reasons over.
  `pos: Coord` is what makes this a GRID world (directions up/down/left/right).

  EVERY `landmark` line MUST carry a trailing `# arc-cell: (row, col)` comment.
  A landmark is level data, so the manual names it and the level places it —
  and there is nowhere in the DSL to write coordinates, which is the point of
  the split. A landmark the level cannot place is a HARD compile error, so a
  landmark you declare without this comment lands at (0,0) and takes your rule
  with it.

  EVERY `object` line MUST carry a trailing `# arc-colour: <n>` comment naming
  the hex colour code that object shows in the frame. That comment is not
  decoration: the level instance is COMPUTED from the frames, and the colour is
  how the arm finds your object in the grid. An object without it is located
  nowhere, is drawn at (0,0), and the responsibility check will report every
  one of its pixels as unexplained.

### OBJECTS WITH EXTENT — read this before declaring anything
An instance is drawn as EXACTLY ONE CELL. A 3x3 token or a 24-pixel ring is
therefore not one instance, however you declare it, and if you declare it as
one then every other cell of it is an unexplained pixel forever.

Add `arc-instances: all` and the arm creates ONE INSTANCE PER CELL, all of the
same declared type, covering every cell of that colour the board cannot explain:

    object Ring  { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 9  arc-instances: all
    object Token { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 1  arc-instances: all
    object Pip   { pos: Coord, color: Int }   # arc-colour: 3

`Pip` has no `arc-instances`, so it is a single cell — correct for a genuine
one-pixel marker, wrong for anything else.

Consequences you must design for:

* **There is no instance called `Ring`.** There are `Ring_r8c14`,
  `Ring_r8c15`, … A rule that names `Ring` will not compile. Write rules over
  the TYPE instead:

        rule shift forall ?p in Ring [ev: t2 cov: 1/1]
          when act=key(2) and free(below(?p)) then moved(?p, down)

  `forall ?p in <ObjectType>` grounds the rule once per instance.
* **Every cell that ever changed needs an owner**, or it is unexplained. Count
  them: the evidence brief gives you `dynamic_cells`. If your declarations
  cannot cover them all, say which are left over and why, in a `theorem`.
* Two objects of the SAME colour still cannot be told apart by this arm — it
  looks objects up by colour and nothing else. Declare one type covering both
  and carry the belief that they are distinct as a `theorem`.

## events:
    event moved(o, dir) | jumped(o, dest) | recolored(o, c) | vanished(o)

  Documentation only -- the backend dispatches on a fixed table, listed below.

## rules:
    rule push_up [ev: t6,t16 cov: 52/52]
      when act=key(1) and free(above(Cart)) then moved(Cart, up)

    rule slide forall ?d in dir [ev: t3 cov: 4/4]
      when act=key(1) and free(toward(Cart, ?d)) then moved(Cart, ?d)

  * the header line ends at `]` -- NO trailing comment on it, and none on the
    `when ... then ...` line either. Both are parse errors.
  * `forall ?v in <domain>` grounds to `<rule>_<value>` rules.
  * every rule carries `[ev: ... cov: k/n]`. Constraint 5: no entry without
    evidence.

### guards -- EXHAUSTIVE. Anything else fails to compile.
    act=<name>(<arg>, ...)      args are bare names or integer literals only
    free(<cell>)                cell renders as the background colour
    colored(<cell>, 7)          second argument must be an INTEGER LITERAL
    adjacent(<cell>, <cell>)
    <value> = <value>           also != < > <= >=  (SPACES around the operator)
    <cell> = wall               tests off-board
  joined by `and`. Use `not` before an atom for negation.

### cells -- EXHAUSTIVE.
    Cart                    an instance name means that instance's position
    exit_cell               a declared landmark
    above(x) below(x) leftof(x) rightof(x)      NOTE: leftof/rightof
    toward(x, ?d)           toward(x, <direction>)
    pos(<value>)

### values
    integer literals; true; false; a landmark name; a direction name;
    an instance name; `Cart.color`; `+` and `-` only (no `*`, no `/`);
    tuple literals like `(3, 7)`.

### events a rule may fire -- EXHAUSTIVE, dispatched on (name, arity).
    moved(o, <dir>)                 o moves one cell
    jumped(o, <landmark>)           o goes to a named cell
    teleported(o, <landmark>)       same shape
    jumped(o, <over-object>, <dir>) o travels two cells; <over> gets alive=False
    recolored(o, <int literal>)
    vanished(o)      -> present=False
    appeared(o)      -> present=True
    removed(o)       -> alive=False
  The first argument is always a bare object name. A bare coordinate as a
  destination is REFUSED -- declare a landmark.

## goal:
    goal Cart.pos = exit_cell
    goal count(Door) = 0
    goal count(Button, color = 8) = 2

  `=` only. `>=`/`<=`/`>`/`<` do not compile. No goal section at all is legal
  and compiles to `is_goal -> False`.

## laws:
    invariant cart_unique count(Cart) = 1 [status: proven]
    theorem exit_needs_key "prose, in the manual's own words"
      [depends: push_up, unlock  probe: pending]

  THE TWO ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE AND THIS IS THE EASIEST MISTAKE TO MAKE:

    `invariant <name> <expr> <op> <value> [status: ...]`
        The body MUST contain one of  =  !=  <  >  <=  >=  . It is an
        equation, not a sentence. `invariant foo "in words ..."` is a parse
        error: "No comparison op in invariant".

    `theorem <name> "<prose>" [depends: ... probe: pending|passed]`
        The body MUST be a quoted sentence. This is where a belief you cannot
        write as an equation goes -- and most of what you want to say after
        six transitions belongs here, not in `invariant`.

  Invariant bodies are stored as RAW TEXT and are not checked by any backend
  (the sole exception is the `pagoda(w)` form, which needs a LINE world and an
  LP certificate and does not apply here). Declaring one is a claim you are
  making, not a claim the compiler will verify -- say so honestly in `status:`.

# playbook.dsl -- four statement forms and nothing else
    order    keys_before_doors            [proof: lean]
    prune    boxed_in and not goal => dead [proof: lean]
    heuristic w_distance                  [admissible: lean]
    prefer   try_unvisited_first          [ev: 3/4 levels]

  Constraint 10: NO literal solutions. A parser heuristic rejects any line that
  looks like a stored action sequence, and any unrecognised line is a hard
  error.

# THE ACTION VOCABULARY FOR THIS WORLD
This game's actions are ARC's ACTION1..ACTION7. Write them as `act=key(<n>)`
and nothing else -- the arm maps ACTION<n> to the tuple ('key', <n>) in both
directions. A click action carries coordinates the guard language cannot
express; if you need one, say so in a `theorem ... [probe: pending]` instead of
inventing syntax.

## The current frame

Each cell is one hex digit 0-f standing for a colour. Row numbers on the left, column numbers on top.

Only the cells that have EVER changed are shown (rows 29-10, cols 54-63); everything outside this box has held one colour for the whole history and is board by definition.

## Every command, and what changed

`t` indexes the state sequence. `frames` is how many grids one command returned -- more than one means the world took several internal steps for a single action.

- t1   ACTION1   frames=2   state=NOT_FINISHED 96 cells changed, rows 30-41, cols 11-22, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

These are PROPOSALS. Nothing here is accepted until you accept it, and an engine cannot name anything -- `obj0` is the best it can do.

## The manual as it stands

```
# theory.dsl -- world observed for 34 states / 33 transitions
# (RESET + A1 A2 A3 A4 A5, then A2 A5 twelve times, then A5 A5 A5 A5).
# 87 cells have ever changed; this manual names and owns all 87.
#
# WHAT THIS ROUND COST AND WHAT IT BOUGHT
#
#   Last round I deleted `colored(spawn_probe, 5)` from thirteen panel rules
#   on a gain-test argument, and said in as many words: my manual now
#   predicts key(5) at spawn toggles 23 panel cells, no frame has ever
#   tested that, if it is wrong I pay 23 pixels and learn something worth
#   more than 23 pixels. THE WORLD ANSWERED. Four commands, all ACTION5,
#   all at spawn, indices 30-33. The panel did not move. Not one panel
#   pixel changed in four presses. THE CUT WAS WRONG AND IT IS REVERSED:
#   the guard is restored on all thirteen rules, and it now has what it
#   never had before -- FOUR NEGATIVE WITNESSES. 13 toggles with the body
#   away, 0 toggles with the body home. The atom is earned.
#
#   THE SAME FOUR COMMANDS SETTLED THE OTHER OPEN QUESTION, and settled it
#   the other way. Row 63 now reads 9 through col 47 and 1 from col 48:
#   SIXTEEN burns, two more than at state 29. Four presses of an ODD key,
#   at indices 30, 31, 32, 33, burned exactly twice -- at 30 and at 32.
#   Reading A (burns iff the key is 2 or 4) predicted ZERO burns and is
#   DEAD. Reading B (burns iff the command index is even) predicted exactly
#   two, in exactly those places, and is now 33/33 with a discriminating
#   set. The meter is a command counter and no key touches it.
#
#   AND THE FOUR COMMANDS PROVED THE THING I HAVE CARRIED AS A BELIEF SINCE
#   STATE 5. s30 and s31 are pixel-identical (distinct_states 30 against 34
#   states = four coincidences: s1=s0, s3=s2, s31=s30, s33=s32). From s30
#   the world was given ACTION5 and returned s31 = s30, identity. From s31,
#   the same pixels, the world was given ACTION5 AGAIN and returned s32,
#   one pixel burned. SAME STATE, SAME ACTION, DIFFERENT SUCCESSOR. This
#   world is NOT a function of the drawn frame, and constraint 5 obliges my
#   manual to be one. See the_world_is_not_a_function_of_the_drawn_frame.
#
#   THE BILL, STATED PLAINLY: replay can no longer be perfect. t31 and t33
#   replay exactly (identity). t30 and t32 each miss by ONE pixel, the
#   parity burn, which no guard in this language can express and which was
#   board at the instant it burned. Expect 31/33. That is the floor, not a
#   defect I can repair, and I would rather post it than hide it behind an
#   action-keyed burn rule that is now known to be a mis-attribution.

  theorem the_cut_is_reversed_and_the_guard_is_now_earned "THE ROUND'S FIRST STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND IT IS AN UNDO OF MINE. Last round I deleted colored(spawn_probe, 5) from thirteen panel rules, on the argument that its thirteen positive witnesses were confounded -- every ACTION5 in history had followed an ACTION2, so `key(5) was pressed` and `the body is away` were the same thirteen events, and constraint 3 says a conjunct with no discriminating negative explains no pixel. THE ARGUMENT WAS SOUND AND THE CONCLUSION WAS FALSE, and the difference between those two sentences is the whole value of this round. The manual then predicted 23 panel cells for key(5) at spawn; the world was asked four times and answered zero panel cells four times. THE ATOM NOW HAS FOUR NEGATIVE WITNESSES -- t30, t31, t32, t33, all ACTION5, all with the body home at spawn, all with the panel unmoved in configuration B, confirmed cell by cell in the current frame which still reads 222/2.2/222 at cols 1-3 and 999/9.9/999 at cols 5-7 with row 5 dark at 1-3 and lit at 5-7. So the guard is restored on all thirteen rules and it is no longer a correlation: 13/13 toggles with the body away, 0/4 with the body home. WHAT I WOULD DO AGAIN: buy a negative witness by removing an unearned guard, because an unwitnessed silence is invisible and an unwitnessed prediction of change is answered in one press. WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY: the answer arrived on the FIRST press and the next three bought nothing new about the panel -- they were paid for by the meter, which is the only reason this round was not a waste."

  theorem the_meter_is_command_parity_and_no_key_touches_it "SETTLED, and settled against the reading my rules encode. Row 63 is a 64-cell colour-9 bar burning 9 to 1 one cell at a time from the right; the current frame reads 9 through col 47 and 1 from col 48 to col 63, SIXTEEN burns after thirty-three commands. Burns occurred at command indices 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32 -- every even index, sixteen of them, no odd index ever. READING A said burns iff the key is 2 or 4. READING B said burns iff the index is even. For twenty-nine commands the two were numerically identical because every command was an even key at an even index or an odd key at an odd index; I said the separator was one odd key at an even index and cost one command. THIS ROUND SPENT FOUR ODD KEYS AT INDICES 30-33 AND READING A PREDICTED ZERO BURNS. Two burns happened, at 30 and 32, exactly where B says. READING A IS DEAD. The meter counts commands, not keys, and it does not care which key. CONSEQUENCE FOR MY THREE BURN RULES: their attribution is now KNOWN FALSE. I keep them anyway and say why -- they are the shortest expressible shadow of the true law, they draw 14 of the 16 burns on replay, and every alternative is worse. A key(5) burn rule would fire at t31 and t33 where nothing burned; an action-free burn rule would fire at every odd index from t5 on and lose seventeen transitions. Fourteen right, two structurally unreachable, and no better option inside this grammar."

  theorem the_world_is_not_a_function_of_the_drawn_frame "PROVEN THIS ROUND, after carrying it as a belief since state 5. The proof needs two pixel-identical states from which the SAME action produced different successors, and the store hands me the pair: distinct_states is 30 against 34 states, so there are exactly four coincidences, and they are s1=s0, s3=s2, s31=s30, s33=s32. The first two are the old sterile pair -- different keys were pressed from each, so they test nothing. THE LAST TWO ARE NOT. Refutations P-25 and P-26 report the SAME observed hash 132f0bf441d96376, and P-27 and P-28 the same 121cbbc9c93803ed: so s31 = s30 and s33 = s32 to the pixel. Now read the transitions. t31 acted on s30 with ACTION5 and returned s31, which equals s30 -- identity. t32 acted on s31, THE SAME PIXELS, with ACTION5 AGAIN, and returned s32, which differs by one burned bar cell. Same state, same action, two different successors. The hidden bit is the command counter the meter reads and no guard in this language can. WHAT IT COSTS ME IS EXACT AND UNAVOIDABLE: constraint 5 obliges my manual to be a function of the frame, so my manual must be wrong about at least one member of every such pair, and it is wrong about t30 and t32 by exactly one pixel each.

Their arithmetic is worth reading because it is how I reconstructed the round. The manual prediction of P-25 is the inert field of P-26 and vice versa -- that is the harness rolling my predicted frame forward without resyncing, so my toggled panel became my next starting point and toggled back, the same closed 2-cycle as the last five rounds. What is NEW is the observed column: P-25 and P-26 observed the same hash, P-27 and P-28 observed the same hash. The world's successors were change, no-change, change, no-change, and the changes are one pixel each at indices 30 and 32. THREE THINGS FELL OUT OF FOUR COMMANDS: the panel guard is earned (four negatives), the meter is command parity (reading A refuted), and the world is not a function of the frame (a pixel-identical pair with the same key and different successors). Compare the six rounds before it: twenty-four refutations, every divergence set a subset of the meter's leading edge, ZERO rules contradicted, nothing learned. A prediction the world can answer is worth more than a prediction that is safe, and this is the evidence for that claim rather than the slogan."

  theorem what_action5_is_after_four_presses_at_home "Three readings survived thirteen presses because all thirteen were made from one cell south of spawn, where UP, UNDO and RETURN are indistinguishable. This round pressed it FOUR TIMES AT SPAWN and the body did not move a pixel. UP predicts exactly that -- north of spawn is void, the move is blocked. RETURN predicts exactly that -- the body is already home. UNDO in its plain form is REFUTED: t29 was an effective ACTION5 that carried the body home, so an undo at t30 would have carried it back south, and it did not. UNDO survives only in a stack variant where no-ops are not pushed and t29 emptied the stack; I record that variant rather than pretend it is dead, but I no longer rank it. THE SEPARATOR IS NOW CHEAP AND NAMED: press ACTION5 from any cell that is neither spawn nor one south with open floor above it. From lattice (1,3), one step east, UP is void so UP predicts nothing while RETURN predicts a 48-pixel jump west to spawn. That is one more reason the east key is the next thing to buy. The coupling I still cannot break is the panel's: it toggles on every effective ACTION5 and on no ineffective one, so it is a counter of ACTION5's successes, and the 7-versus-9 cascade split says its state is not merely cosmetic."

  theorem the_panel_guard_is_earned_but_its_extrapolation_is_not "The restored guard reads colored(spawn_probe, 5), which is `cell (8,14) renders floor`, which is `the body is not at spawn`. Every one of the thirteen positives had the body at ONE specific cell, lattice (2,2), and every one of the four negatives had it at spawn. So a guard reading `the body is at (2,2)` -- a second landmark at (14,14) tested for colour 9 -- fits the same 13 positives and the same 4 negatives EXACTLY as well. The two guards differ only at cells the body has never occupied: from a third cell, spawn_probe says the panel toggles and a south_probe would say it does not. I choose spawn_probe because it is the guard that already replayed twenty-five transitions and because the panel reads as a counter of effective ACTION5s rather than of one location, but I am naming the confound BEFORE it costs me, unlike last round. THE PROBE: get the body to any third lattice cell and press ACTION5. Panel toggles, spawn_probe wins; panel still, the guard is really about (2,2) and thirteen rules need a different landmark."

SECOND: the true meter law is `burns iff the command index is even`, and the guard language reads pixels and the action name and nothing else. There is no command counter, no phase pixel, and the frame provably does not determine the parity, since s30 and s31 are identical and only one of them was followed by a burn.

Thirteen rules rest on this and every row and column discrimination in the panel is built from it: the k-th above is off-board exactly when k exceeds the row, so row 1 is above-twice equals wall, row 3 is a colour test on above-twice -- false for row 1 precisely because a colour test on an off-board cell is false -- and row 2 is above-three equals wall conjoined with a colour test on above-once. The same trick separates slot 2's middle row by column: col 5 is leftof-six equals wall, col 6 is leftof-seven equals wall with a colour test on leftof-once, col 7 is a colour test on leftof-twice, pairwise exclusive, which is why the ambiguity check reports 0 clashes.

Thirteen panel rules once carried colored(spawn_probe, 5) while the landmark line read a prose placeholder instead of a coordinate; the grammar puts such a landmark at (0,0), (0,0) is background in every frame this world has drawn, and so all thirteen rules were unreachable text that fired never and clashed never. Responsibility passed, ambiguity passed, step crashed zero times, and ONLY replay caught it. The coda, now complete: that same atom was deleted last round for failing the gain test and is restored this round with four negative witnesses. It has been wrong by pointing nowhere, wrong by being absent, and is now right for a reason I can state. The landmark reads (8, 14), the top-left pixel of the spawn ring, which renders 9 while the body is home and 5 the moment it is anywhere else. Before ranking any probe, check that the rules it is meant to test can actually fire."

  theorem i_cannot_manufacture_an_instance_on_a_cell_that_has_never_changed "Recorded because a future desk will be tempted by the same repair I have now rejected five times. To draw the leading-edge burn I would need an instance on a board cell. The arm offers exactly one lever, arc-instances: all, and its documented behaviour is to instance every cell OF THAT COLOUR THE BOARD CANNOT EXPLAIN -- a never-varying cell is precisely what the board explains, so it gets no instance. The tempting workaround is a second declared type on colour 9 without arc-instances, hoping the arm seats one instance somewhere useful. I reject it: the arm looks objects up by colour and nothing else, so a second colour-9 type is indistinguishable from Glyph9, the seat is unspecified, and any cell it landed on would be claimed twice, which is the constraint-5 error the grammar warns about in as many words. A landmark cannot help either, because landmarks are cells and every event in the language takes an object as its first argument. So the hole is a property of the arm, it is permanent for this level, and with parity confirmed it now costs one pixel on EVERY second command rather than only on key 2 and key 4."

Its eighteen tracks corroborate the panel by frame index and one of them corroborates THIS ROUND specifically: obj17, colour 2, first_frame 29, frames_present 5 -- the only colour-2 track longer than two frames, which is the panel standing still through t30-t33 exactly as the restored guard requires. obj0 and obj2 persisting through all 34 frames while the segmenter narrates 26 moves is the marker-with-two-seats reading. obj4 is the whole 64-cell bar of which 16 cells are now dynamic. obj3 is a 1006-cell colour-null blob that swallowed the maze floor AND the body ring: connected_components(4) cannot see the mover at all, because the mover is a ring of floor-adjacent pixels that merges with the floor, and THAT ABSENCE IS THE FINDING. None of these gets a type of its own; a second type on the same pixels invites the double claim rule 5 forbids. zero_space self-reports THIN in its own words -- 33 transitions constrain rank 17 of 435 features, null space dimension 418, nearly every vector in it a law true over these states and unfalsified rather than confirmed -- and its single global law is my census. cegis_miner refuses on every track and its verdict, `the world does not narrate as one mover`, remains true of the arm and false of the world: there is one mover, a rigid 24-pixel ring, and the arm can only see 24 simultaneous recolours."

## The playbook as it stands

```
# playbook.dsl -- what to buy with the next command, not a route.
#
# ========= WHAT THE LAST FOUR COMMANDS SETTLED =========
# Four presses of ACTION5 at spawn, indices 30-33. The panel did not move.
# Two bar cells burned, at indices 30 and 32.
#
#   1. THE CUT IS REVERSED. `colored(spawn_probe, 5)` is back on thirteen
#      panel rules and it now has FOUR NEGATIVE WITNESSES: 13/13 toggles
#      with the body away, 0/4 with the body home. ACTION5 at spawn is a
#      witnessed no-op.
#   2. THE METER IS COMMAND PARITY. Four ODD keys at indices 30-33 burned
#      exactly twice, at the two EVEN indices. The action-keyed reading
#      predicted zero burns and is dead. 33/33 for parity, with a
#      discriminating set at last. No key touches the meter.
#   3. THE WORLD IS NOT A FUNCTION OF THE DRAWN FRAME -- PROVEN. s30 and
#      s31 are pixel-identical; ACTION5 from s30 returned identity and
#      ACTION5 from s31 burned a cell. Same pixels, same key, two
#      successors.
#
# The wrong prediction was worth more than six safe rounds. But only the
# FIRST of the four presses answered it; presses two, three and four were
# the harness re-choosing the same key against a rolled-forward frame, and
# they were paid for by the meter alone. Buying a negative witness is right;
# buying it four times is not.
#
# ========= THE BOARD AS THE MANUAL NOW SEES IT =========
#   At spawn (where the body IS):  key(2) -> 48 body cells
#                                  keys 1, 5 -> nothing, WITNESSED
#                                  keys 3, 4 -> nothing, NO WITNESS
#   Index 34 is EVEN, so (63,47) burns under every key and I cannot draw it:
#   one guaranteed wrong pixel this turn whatever is pressed, and
#   refutation-fired carries ZERO information at an even index.
#
# ========= THE ONE THING WORTH BUYING =========
# EAST IS ACTION3 OR ACTION4 AND ONE PRESS SETTLES IT.
#   ACTION2 is down (13/13). ACTION1 is not east -- pressed at spawn at t1
#   with east open, nothing moved. ACTION5 is not east -- pressed at spawn
#   four times this round with east open, nothing moved. Two candidates
#   remain and the body is standing where the test is free: east of spawn is
#   three lattice cells of unbroken floor, west is void.
#   Press ACTION3 (or ACTION4): if the body steps, that key is EAST and the
#   map is closed; if it does not, the OTHER is east by elimination. Both
#   outcomes name the east key. No other command on the board names anything.
#
# The advertised price of the step onto fresh ground: 48 pixels my manual
# cannot draw, because rows 8-12 cols 20-24 have never changed and are board.
# That is a refutation I have priced in advance and it must not be read as a
# defect. 24 pixels for the second step, 0 for the third.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# STATE 33: body home at lattice (1,2); panel configuration B; SIXTEEN meter
# cells burned, cols 48-63 of row 63; next command index 34, EVEN. Eleven
# lattice cells reachable, the body has stood in TWO in thirty-four states.
# Three steps east along lattice row 1 reach the cell beside the knob; the
# knob is the far end of one connected colour-8 wire whose near end is the
# comb; the comb gates every route to the socket at (8,7). Under parity the
# bar buys about 96 more commands against a route of about nineteen steps:
# the budget is not binding, repetition is.

# theory.dsl -- REWRITTEN FROM SCRATCH. This is not the world the previous
# manual described.
#
# WHY THE OLD MANUAL IS GONE, IN ONE PARAGRAPH
#
#   The store now reads: 6 states, 6 steps, 5 transitions, background 5,
#   97 dynamic cells, dynamic box rows 29-54 cols 10-63, colours seen
#   {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,14}, actions used A1 A2 A3 A4 A7. The manual I was
#   handed described 34 states, an 87-cell dynamic set at rows 8-18 and
#   row 63, a 5x5 body ring, a two-slot panel and a 64-cell meter bar. Not
#   one of those pixels exists in these frames. This is a different level
#   (the surprise says level 1) with a fresh store. Every rule, every
#   landmark and every count in that manual is about geometry that is not
#   on this board, so keeping any of it would be inventing pixels. I have
#   kept exactly three things from it and they are all method, not content:
#   price your defects in advance, never write a rule the diff did not
#   show you cell by cell, and check that a rule can fire before ranking a
#   probe that tests it.
#
# THE SURPRISE THAT BROUGHT ME HERE, AND MY ANSWER
#
#   certify: "theory.dsl is non-empty but generated/theory.py could not be
#   loaded". The old manual did not COMPILE, so replay, responsibility and
#   ambiguity all reported nothing. Two constructs in it are the plausible
#   causes and this manual removes both:
#     (1) `landmark spawn_probe  # arc-cell: carried, coordinates stripped`
#         -- the grammar says a landmark the level cannot place is a HARD
#         compile error, and "carried, coordinates stripped" is not a
#         coordinate. THIS MANUAL DECLARES NO LANDMARKS AT ALL. Every
#         discrimination below is done with colour and neighbour tests, so
#         there is nothing for the level to fail to place.
#     (2) a bare `goal:` header with an empty body. "No goal section at all
#         is legal"; an EMPTY one is not documented to be. THIS MANUAL HAS
#         NO GOAL SECTION.
#   I cannot bisect a compiler I cannot run, so I say plainly: I have
#   removed the two constructs I can argue for and I do not know which one
#   it was. If theory.py still fails to load, the cause is neither, and the
#   next desk should delete rule blocks in halves rather than re-reason.
#
# WHAT I ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT THIS WORLD
#
#   Every one of the 97 dynamic cells is accounted for, and the account is
#   not my guess -- zero_space's single global law enumerates its cells and
#   they are exactly these four rectangles plus one corner pixel:
#     icon1  rows 30-35 x cols 11-16   36 cells
#     icon2  rows 36-41 x cols 11-16   36 cells
#     tape1  rows 32-33 x cols 17-22   12 cells
#     tape2  rows 38-39 x cols 17-22   12 cells
#     meter  (53,63)                    1 cell
#   36+36+12+12+1 = 97 = dynamic_cells, exactly.
#
#   Three of the five transitions are known cell by cell and are fully
#   ruled below. Two of them -- A1 and A2 -- were reported only as a count,
#   a bounding box and two colour sets, so I have NO cell-level evidence and
#   I write NO rule. That is the one large hole and I price it in advance:
#   replay will miss t1 and t2 by up to 96 cells each and be exact on
#   t3, t4, t5. Expect 3/5.

The bounding box of that set is rows 30-41 x cols 11-63, which is the reported box [29,10,54,63] padded by one on each side, so the two agree exactly and nothing is left over. I name the four parts by what the pixels look like rather than by what they do, because what they do is only partly known: ICON1 rows 30-35 cols 11-16, ICON2 rows 36-41 cols 11-16, TAPE1 rows 32-33 cols 17-22, TAPE2 rows 38-39 cols 17-22, METER (53,63).

  theorem the_census_closes_to_the_pixel_and_that_is_why_seven_types "Read the frame-0 colour of all 97 cells from the current frame (which IS frame 0 outside tape2, since s2 = s0 and s5 differs from s0 only in tape2 and the meter, and tape2's frame-0 colours are recoverable from the t4 diff). ICON1: cols 11,12,15,16 x rows 30-35 render background 5, that is 24 cells; cols 13,14 x rows 30,31,34,35 render 3, that is 8; cols 13,14 x rows 32,33 render 2, that is 4. ICON2: 22 cells of colour 6, 12 of colour 0, plus (38,16) colour 1 and (39,16) colour 2. TAPE1: 12 cells of colour 4. TAPE2, from the t4 diff's target colours: 8 of colour 1 and 4 of colour 2. METER: 1 of colour 2. By colour the totals are 0:12, 1:9, 2:10, 3:8, 4:12, 5:24, 6:22, summing to 97. TWO INDEPENDENT CHECKS PASS. First, 97 - 24 = 73 = cells_needing_an_owner exactly, and the 24 excluded are precisely the background-coloured ones -- so the store's `needing an owner` means `dynamic and not the background colour`, and Ink5 is the type that owns the 24 the store does not count. Second, 4096 - 97 = 3999 = constant_cells exactly. That is why there are seven types and not four: the arm looks objects up by colour and nothing else, so a type per frame-0 colour is the ONLY declaration that owns every dynamic cell. It buys no structure and I do not pretend it does -- ICON1 is spread across Ink5, Ink3 and Ink2 and no rule can say `icon1`."

  theorem the_ninety_six_cell_transition_is_the_hole_and_here_is_its_price "A1 and A2 each changed 96 cells in rows 30-41 x cols 11-22 and the diff reported a COUNT, A BOX AND TWO COLOUR SETS AND NOTHING ELSE. 96 is exactly icon1 + icon2 + tape1 + tape2, so I know that EVERY dynamic cell of the widget area changes under A1 and again under A2 and that the meter does not. I also know A2 undoes A1: distinct_states is 5 against 6 states, so exactly one pair coincides, and it can only be s0 = s2 because s3, s4, s5 are separated from each other and from s0 by the tape and the meter. So A2 o A1 is the identity on this state. WHAT I DO NOT KNOW is which colour each of the 96 cells takes, and no amount of reasoning recovers it from a colour SET. THEREFORE I WRITE NO RULE. The compiled step is total, so my manual predicts identity for key(1) and key(2), which is KNOWN FALSE by 96 cells each. I state the bill before certify does: t1 misses 96, t2 misses 96, t3 t4 t5 are exact, expect replay 3/5. This is a defect of my evidence and not of my vocabulary, and it is repaired by one command and no thought at all -- see the_cheapest_command_on_this_board."

The frame I am NOT shown is s1, the configuration A1 produces, because it was two states ago and the diff that made it was summarised. So the entire content of the 96-cell hole is one press away: press key(1) now, and next round the current frame IS the other configuration, cell by cell, and the A1 and A2 rules can be written from pixels instead of guessed. Nothing else on this board buys 96 cells. The cost is exactly the refutation I priced above -- 96 divergent cells on a transition whose ignorance I declared in advance -- and it must not be read as the manual failing. A second press of key(1) afterwards is worth almost as much and answers a different question: if it returns to s0 the widget is a 2-cycle, and if it produces a third configuration it is a longer cycle or a scroll, which changes what a rule over it has to say."

  theorem tape2_is_hidden_and_shown_and_the_guard_that_isolates_it "Three transitions, 12 cells each way, and they are the whole of what this manual predicts. In s0 the seven cells (38,16)-(38,22) render 1,2,1,1,2,1,1 and (39,16)-(39,22) render 2,1,1,2,1,1,2 -- one diagonal stripe pattern, colour 2 exactly where (row + col) mod 3 = 1 and colour 1 elsewhere, verified on all fourteen. Six of each row, cols 17-22, are dynamic; the col-16 pair never changes and is board. key(3) at t3 and key(7) at t5 turned all twelve to 4, the colour of the canvas they sit in; key(4) at t4 turned all twelve back to their stripe colours, each to its own. So the tape is SEVEN long when shown and ONE long when hidden, or equivalently the canvas is painted over it -- the two readings are the same pixels and I take the painting one because it is what a recolour rule can say. THE GUARD. `colored(above(above(?p)), 4)` is what separates the twelve tape cells from the other seven Ink1 and Ink2 instances, and I checked every one: (38,16) has (36,16) = 6, (39,16) has (37,16) = 6, the four icon1 cells at rows 32,33 cols 13,14 have (30,13)=(30,14)=(31,13)=(31,14) = 3, and the meter (53,63) has (51,63) = 5 -- all excluded, while every tape cell has (36,c) or (37,c) = 4.

  theorem the_guard_i_did_not_write_and_why "I considered conjoining `colored(below(below(?p)), 4)` to all six tape rules. It is TRUE of every one of the twelve tape cells -- (40,c) and (41,c) are canvas -- and it excludes not one instance that `colored(above(above(?p)), 4)` had not already excluded. It therefore has ZERO discriminating witnesses and constraint 3 keeps it out: a conjunct that explains no pixel does not earn a line. I am recording the confound rather than burying it, because the two guards differ on cells no frame has shown: after key(1) redraws the widget area, an Ink1 or Ink2 instance could land somewhere with canvas two above and something else two below, and there the one-atom guard fires and the two-atom guard does not. THE PROBE IS THE SAME PRESS I ALREADY WANT: expose the other configuration, then press key(3) in it. If twelve cells hide, the guard survives; if more than twelve hide, the second atom was load-bearing and goes back in. I have been burned before by deleting an unearned atom, and the lesson I took was not `never delete` -- it was `delete, and name the press that will answer you`."

  theorem tape1_has_never_been_shown "TAPE1, rows 32-33 cols 17-22, renders colour 4 in every one of the six observed frames, and yet all twelve of its cells are in zero_space's dynamic list. Both statements can only be true if TAPE1 was non-4 in some frame I was not shown at cell level -- which is s1, the A1 configuration. That is independent corroboration of the reading: the t1 diff's before-colour set contains 4, and the only dynamic cells rendering 4 in s0 are exactly these twelve. So A1 shows tape1 and hides or changes tape2, and A2 puts it back. It also says something about key(3), key(4) and key(7): all three touched only tape2, never tape1, in three transitions. Either those keys address the second list row specifically, or they address `the shown tape` and tape1 was already hidden. I cannot separate those two readings from here and I will not pretend to; one press of key(4) after the A1 press separates them, because it would act on tape1 under the first reading and on tape2 under the second."

It sits at the right end of row 53, a row that renders 2 across the whole window and is otherwise constant, above row 54 which renders 4 across the whole window -- a status bar at the bottom of the screen with one cell consumed at its right edge. THREE READINGS FIT ONE WITNESS EQUALLY WELL. (A) key(4) advances it: 1/1, and it is what I wrote, because it is the only reading the guard language can express at all. (B) SHOWING the tape advances it, whatever key does the showing: also 1/1, and t4 is the only reveal in history. (C) it counts something else entirely -- a score, a move budget, a level timer -- that happened to tick once. WHAT KILLS THE READING THE PREVIOUS LEVEL TAUGHT ME: command-index parity predicted burns at indices 2 and 4 and only index 4 burned, so parity is REFUTED here and I do not carry it over. THE SEPARATOR IS ONE COMMAND AND I NAME ITS PREDICTION. The tape is hidden now and the meter renders 3, so my rule cannot fire; press key(4) and my manual predicts exactly 12 cells and no meter change. If the meter advances anyway, reading A is a counter rather than a one-shot and the guard `colored(?p, 2)` is wrong; if it does not, I have a negative witness where I currently have none."

I have one witness apiece and no state in which they differ. THE GRAMMAR HAS NO `or`, so `act=key(3) or act=key(7)` cannot be written and I paid four rules where two would do -- a doubling I am declaring rather than hiding, and the honest reason is expressiveness, not evidence. TWO THINGS ARE NOT THE SAME ABOUT THEM. key(7) returned ONE frame; key(1), key(2), key(3) and key(4) each returned TWO. cascade_lengths is [1,2] and max_frames_in_one_command is 2, so key(7) is the only single-frame command in this world's history. That is a free channel my semantics discards by construction -- cascade single_frame compares only the net -- and it is the only evidence that 3 and 7 are different mechanisms with a coinciding net effect. THE SEPARATOR: press one of them when the tape is already HIDDEN. If it is `hide`, nothing happens; if it is `toggle`, twelve cells show. Two presses separate hide from toggle for both keys, and my manual currently predicts nothing for either in that state -- an unwitnessed silence, which is the shape of claim this world has punished before."

In this action family one command conventionally carries coordinates -- a click -- and that is a prior about the family, not evidence about this world; note that ACTION7 was used here and ACTION6 was not, which is mild evidence that the usual numbering does not hold. IT MATTERS BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS BOARD LOOKS LIKE: two icons, two value tapes, a scrollbar-shaped 2-wide colour-3 track at cols 13-14 with a colour-2 segment at rows 32-33, a large colour-4 canvas, a 4x4 colour-14 block at rows 31-34 cols 42-45 that has never changed, and a status bar. That is the anatomy of a MENU, and menus are usually pointed at. I CANNOT WRITE A CLICK RULE: the guard language admits act=key(6) but has nowhere to put two coordinates, so such a rule would fire on every click anywhere and be silently wrong about which cell was clicked.

The canvas is colour 4 filling rows 29-41 cols 17-46, with a 4x4 colour-14 block at rows 31-34 cols 42-45 that has not changed in six frames. Col 47 and beyond in rows 29-41 is background 5.

  theorem what_the_engines_gave_me "zero_space is the round's one useful engine and it gave me the census, not a law: its single global law enumerates exactly the 97 dynamic cells and that enumeration is what turned my four-rectangle reading from a guess into an arithmetic identity. Its own verdict on its laws is THIN in its own words -- 5 transitions constrain rank 3 of 679 features, null space dimension 676, nearly every vector in it true over these states and unfalsified rather than confirmed -- so I took the cell list and left the law. mdl_segmenter I REJECT WHOLESALE and its own numbers are why: both variants have NEGATIVE gain, -4037 bits at split_by_color=false and -10409 at true, so by its own measure its segmentation loses to writing the pixels out. Its tracks say what is wrong with connected_components(4) here: obj0 (frame 0), obj2 (frame 1), obj3 (frames 2-5) are all ~440-cell 13x36 blobs, which is one blob -- the canvas with the widgets embedded in it -- being re-identified as a new object every time any pixel inside it changes; obj1 is the 2x54 bottom bar. Four-connectivity cannot separate a widget from a canvas it is drawn on, and THAT ABSENCE IS THE FINDING. cegis_miner refused every track and its verdict, `the world does not narrate as one mover`, is TRUE here and not merely an artefact: nothing in six frames moved, everything recoloured in place."

So my complete ignorance of key(1) is emitted in the same voice as my three-times-witnessed knowledge of key(3), and only this prose distinguishes them. SECOND: guards join with `and` only. key(3) and key(7) have identical observed effects and I cannot write one rule for both, so six rules do the work of three and the manual is longer than the world. I record both rather than working around them, because a workaround here means inventing a distinction the evidence does not support.

A goal over the meter would need me to know what the meter counts, and I have one witness and three readings for it. There is also a structural reason nothing can be named: `arc-instances: all` gives me Ink2_r53c63 and nine siblings, so there is no single instance to write `X.pos = exit_cell` about, and I have declared no landmarks at all after the compile failure.

The previous manual was thirty theorems long, replayed twenty-five transitions in earlier rounds and had a carefully argued account of its own defects -- and this round it scored NOTHING, because theory.py could not be loaded. Responsibility: empty. Replay: empty. Unambiguous: null. A manual that does not compile is not a slightly worse manual, it is no manual, and every hour of reasoning inside it is unbanked. TWO CONCRETE RULES FALL OUT. First, prefer constructs that cannot fail to be placed: this manual has no landmarks, no goal section and no domain, and every discrimination is a colour test on a cell reachable by above/below/leftof/rightof from an instance. Second, when a section is optional, OMIT IT rather than emit it empty -- an empty `goal:` header was legal-looking and may well have been the fault. Small and running beats large and dark, and this manual is deliberately the former."

# playbook.dsl -- what to buy with the next command, not a route.
#
# ========= WHERE THIS ROUND STANDS =========
# The world changed under me: this is a new level with a fresh store, six
# states, 97 dynamic cells, none of the old geometry. The old manual did not
# compile, so it scored nothing at all. The new one is small, has no
# landmarks and no goal section, and predicts three of five transitions
# exactly.
#
# ========= THE BOARD AS THE MANUAL NOW SEES IT =========
#   97 dynamic cells, and every one has an owner:
#     icon1 rows 30-35 cols 11-16 (36)   icon2 rows 36-41 cols 11-16 (36)
#     tape1 rows 32-33 cols 17-22 (12)   tape2 rows 38-39 cols 17-22 (12)
#     meter (53,63) (1)
#   KNOWN CELL BY CELL: key(3) and key(7) hide tape2, twelve cells; key(4)
#   shows it, twelve cells, and advanced the meter once.
#   NOT KNOWN AT ALL: key(1) and key(2) each change all 96 widget cells and
#   the diff reported only a count, a box and two colour sets. key(5) and
#   key(6) have never been pressed.
#   Current state: tape2 hidden, tape1 hidden, meter reads 3.
#
# ========= THE ONE THING WORTH BUYING =========
# THE FRAME I AM SHOWN IS THE CURRENT ONE, IN FULL. The 96-cell hole is not
# a hole in my reasoning, it is a hole in what the summariser printed, and
# it closes the instant the other configuration BECOMES the current frame.
# Press the key whose diff was never itemised. Next round the pixels are on
# the page and two rules can be written from evidence instead of guessed.
#
# The advertised price: my manual predicts zero cells there and the world
# will change 96. That refutation is declared in advance, in the manual, in
# writing, and it must not be read as a defect. Every other command on this
# board buys at most twelve cells and most buy one.
#
# ========= THE THREE CHEAP QUESTIONS BEHIND IT =========
#   1. HIDE OR TOGGLE. tape2 is hidden now, so a hide-key pressed here does
#      nothing under one reading and shows twelve cells under the other. My
#      manual predicts silence and has NO witness for it.
#   2. ONE-SHOT OR COUNTER. The meter rule fires only on colour 2 and the
#      meter now reads 3, so my manual predicts the show-key moves twelve
#      cells and not thirteen. Thirteen refutes the guard.
#   3. TWO KEYS OR ONE. The two hide-keys have identical twelve-cell effects
#      and differ only in frame count, one versus two. Nothing separates
#      them yet and I wrote each rule twice because the grammar has no `or`.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Do not read a divergence on the widget area as a failed rule: there is no
# rule there, only a declared ignorance, and closing it is the whole plan.

   "why": "the diff gave a count, a bounding box and two colour sets and no cell-level mapping; writing a rule would be inventing 96 pixels, so the manual predicts identity and declares the resulting 96-cell miss on t1 and t2 in advance"},

  {"id": "R-06", "subject": "adding colored(below(below(?p)),4) to the six tape rules", "verdict": "reject",
   "why": "true of all 12 tape cells and excludes zero instance the existing atom had not already excluded, so it has no discriminating witness and fails the gain test; the confound is recorded and its probe named"},

  {"id": "R-07", "subject": "cegis_miner tracks obj0-obj3", "verdict": "reject",
   "why": "all four refused, and the engine's own verdict that the world does not narrate as one mover is correct here -- nothing moved in six frames, everything recoloured in place"},

  {"id": "L-01", "subject": "constant 3999 + dynamic 97 = 4096 and 97 - 24 = 73", "verdict": "accept",
   "as": "the invariant block",
   "why": "both identities close to the pixel against the store, which is what licenses seven colour-keyed types as a complete ownership scheme"},

  {"id": "L-02", "subject": "command-index parity as the meter law, carried from the previous level", "verdict": "reject",
   "why": "parity predicts burns at indices 2 and 4; only index 4 changed the meter, so parity is refuted in this world and is not carried over"},

  {"id": "L-03", "subject": "s0 = s2, i.e. key(2) undoes key(1) on this state", "verdict": "accept",
   "as": "theorem the_ninety_six_cell_transition_is_the_hole_and_here_is_its_price",
   "why": "distinct_states = 5 over 6 states forces exactly one coincidence, and s3, s4, s5 are pairwise separated by the tape and the meter, so the pair can only be s0 and s2"},

  {"id": "L-04", "subject": "the tape2 stripe pattern is colour 2 iff (row + col) mod 3 = 1", "verdict": "accept",
   "as": "prose in tape2_is_hidden_and_shown_and_the_guard_that_isolates_it",
   "why": "verified on all fourteen cells of rows 38-39 cols 16-22; recorded as description only, since no rule needs it and the two types already carry the restore colours"},

  {"id": "P-01", "subject": "press the key whose 96-cell diff was never itemised", "verdict": "probe-pending",
   "why": "the current frame is displayed in full, so making the other configuration current is the only way to obtain the pixel map that two missing rules need; cost is a declared 96-cell divergence"},

  {"id": "P-02", "subject": "press a hide-key while tape2 is already hidden", "verdict": "probe-pending",
   "why": "separates hide from toggle and converts an unwitnessed silence into a witnessed one; the manual currently asserts zero cells with no evidence at all"},

  {"id": "P-03", "subject": "press key(4) while the meter renders 3", "verdict": "probe-pending",
   "why": "the manual predicts twelve cells and no meter change; thirteen would refute colored(?p, 2) in a4_advances_the_corner_pixel and show the meter is a counter"},

  {"id": "P-04", "subject": "key(5) and key(6), never pressed", "verdict": "probe-pending",
   "why": "entirely unconstrained after six states; one of them is plausibly the pointer this menu-shaped board wants, and any pixel either moves is a whole action learned"},

  {"id": "E-01", "subject": "act=key(3) or act=key(7)", "verdict": "probe-pending",
   "why": "wanted one rule for two keys with identical observed effects; guards join with `and` only, so I wrote four rules where two would do and declared the duplication as an expressiveness cost, not a claim that the keys differ"},

  {"id": "E-02", "subject": "a click action carrying coordinates", "verdict": "probe-pending",
   "why": "wanted a rule for a pointer press on a specific cell; the guard language has nowhere to put two coordinates, so such a rule would fire on every click anywhere; wrote theorem two_keys_have_never_been_pressed_and_one_of_them_is_probably_a_pointer instead"},

  {"id": "E-03", "subject": "an explicit `unknown` successor for a (state, action) pair", "verdict": "probe-pending",
   "why": "wanted key(1) and key(2) to say `I decline to predict`; the compiled step is total, so absence of a rule emits identity in the same voice as knowledge, and the only remedy available was to state the 96-cell bill in prose before certify reports it"},

  {"id": "E-04", "subject": "an empty goal: section and a landmark without coordinates", "verdict": "reject",
   "why": "the two constructs I can argue caused theory.py to fail to load; both are omitted entirely from this manual, and since I cannot run the compiler I say plainly that I do not know which one it was"}
