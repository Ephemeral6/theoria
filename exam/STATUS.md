Tests: **157 passed, 1 skipped**. The skip is `test_the_old_theory_stand_in_matches_the_compiled_manual`, which unblocks itself when the A0 manual can be parsed again — see the cross-track note below.

## What the rehearsal actually measured

**The marker is calibrated on all four papers.** `oracle` 1.000 and `null` 0.000
exactly, everywhere. The two informative fakes behaved as the protocol requires:

* **held-out** — the memoriser scored **1.00 on replay and 0.15 on held-out**, a
  gap of **0.85**, with `blocked_crossing` at 0/5 held-out against 5/5 replay.
  That is a0-spike's T-9 finding reproduced as one cell of a table instead of as
  a paragraph in a log.
* **verdict** — the bluffer showed **sensitivity 1.0, specificity 0.0** and
  scored 0.265. A framework that answers "unsolvable" to everything is caught by
  the pair, exactly as `Theoria.md` 1.11 demands.
* **adaptation** — the memoriser tripped **`silently_wrong` twice**: under two of
  the six variants the `mismatch` level becomes solvable, and a theory that keeps
  its old verdict is confidently wrong about a world it no longer describes. The
  bluffer scores the *same total* and trips the flag zero times; the two are
  separated only by `axes()`, which is the argument for having the flag.

**Determinism holds.** Sheets, keys and specs are byte-identical across rebuilds
and across `PYTHONHASHSEED` 7 and 99.

**Leakage: 1,790 probes declared, 0 probe hits, 0 structural hits**, and no
paper is clustered by answer — *after* the two leaks below were fixed.

## The cheater earned its place — two real leaks, both measured

Four sheets went to cheater subagents with no other context. They found two
leaks that the static checks had passed, and both were confirmed against the
answer key before anything was touched.

| leak | measured yield | status |
|---|---|---|
| verdict `points`: 3.0 ⟺ solvable, 2.0 ⟺ unsolvable | **17/17 claims**, the whole claim half, no board reasoning | fixed — uniform points |
| held-out `world.description` published "a push slides the box two cells" | 47.5% → near 100% | fixed — the world block no longer states dynamics |

A third finding, on the handover paper, was measured at **11/12 against a 7/12
majority baseline** — real, but its nature is sharper than a syntax tell: the
`name_class` definitions are *classifying* rather than merely *identifying*, so
those items are answerable from the sheet alone and do not test the delivered
manual at all. Not fixed; see open weakness 9.

Two cheater claims did **not** survive checking, and are recorded because an
unverified cheater is just another confident agent:

* the adaptation `match`-level "tell" was estimated at 50–70% and scores **1/6** —
  the name primes the wrong answer for five of six variants;
* the verdict `points` finding was self-reported with a circularity caveat; it
  was verified directly against the key and is exact.

**The deeper fault was in the checker.** `answer_labels` was an optional hook,
no paper module implemented it, and so checks 3 and 4 silently did nothing on
all four papers. An optional check is a check that does not run. Labels are now
derived from the key directly, a fourth check tests whether `points`/`tags`/`kind`
predicts the answer, and regression tests pin the exact leak that shipped.
Details and the three false positives that shaped it: `DECISIONS.md` D-EX-011.

## The handover result, and why it is weaker than it looks

Two fresh subagent readers — no history, no repository, bundle and sheet only —
both scored **46/46 = 1.000**. The author baseline is also 1.000.

* `reader_minus_author = 0.000`. 新读者打平作者: for this manual and this sheet,
  the understanding is in the document.
* `tier2_minus_tier1 = 0.000`.

**The second number is not a measurement.** Both tiers hit the ceiling, so the
paper had no room left to show a difference. A zero delta from a saturated sheet
is uninformative about the value of the playbook, and reporting it as "the
playbook is worth nothing" would be wrong. The sheet needs harder items — boards
where a manual-only reader must actually pay for the search — before the delta
means anything.

**Worse, the exam measures the wrong side of the pre-registered prediction.**
`Theoria.md` 1.11 predicts that the manual-only reader *catches up*, and that the
difference shows up as **多付的搜索成本 ≈ 玩法书缓存的计算量** — a cost, not an
accuracy. The tier-2 reader said so unprompted: the playbook "saved effort, not
error". The exam has **no cost instrument**, so the quantity 1.11 actually
predicts was never measured. Session cost was incidentally observed (tier 1:
50,475 tokens / 10 tool calls / 134 s; tier 2: 54,944 / 11 / 156 s) but it is
n=1, in the wrong direction, and confounded by tier 2 simply having more to read.
It is recorded as an observation and is not evidence of anything.

## A defect in the A0 manual, found three times independently

The handover builder, the tier-1 reader and the tier-2 reader each arrived at
this without knowledge of the others:

> `a0-spike/theory/theory.dsl` records
> `invariant box_row_parity (Box.pos.row) mod 2 = 1 [status: proven]`.
> What `push2` conserves is the **parity** of each coordinate. The **value** `1`
> is a fact about the board the evidence came from. All three invariants are
> written this way, and `theorem unsolvable_mismatch` inherits the flaw: it
> hard-codes "the box starts even, the target is odd" instead of stating the
> general mismatch test.

So the manual ships, marked `proven`, a sentence that is **false on most boards
of its own world** — including several on the exam sheet. It is a live instance
of the failure mode `Theoria.md` §1.3 is about: a statement that passes its type
check and is false of the world. The bundles keep it verbatim; repairing a
deliverable in order to examine it would be examining a document nobody shipped.

This is a finding about `a0-spike`, which P-15 holds read-only. Nothing was
fixed.

## Cross-track: the A0 manual no longer parses

`pipeline.gen_exec.compile_module` refuses `a0-spike/theory/theory.dsl`:

    SemanticsError: theory.dsl has no `semantics:` section ... see
    CONTRACTS/dsl_grammar_v0.2.md

The grammar moved to v0.2 and made `semantics:` mandatory; the v0.1 A0 manual
predates it. **This reproduces on `master` and was not caused by this branch** —
`a0-spike/tests/test_a0.py` errors on import there too. The handover author
baseline falls back to the checked-in `a0-spike/artifacts/theory_exec.py` and
records both the fallback and the refusal text in the truth file. Raised in
`PARTNER_SYNC.md`; not fixed here, because `a0-spike/` is outside P-15's
territory.

The refusal itself looks correct — assuming a default frame axiom would compile a
manual into a different world silently. The gap is that nothing migrated A0.

## Open weaknesses

1. **The handover sheet saturates.** See above. Until it has items that
   discriminate, neither tier number carries information, and the pre-registered
   1.11 prediction is untested.
2. **No cost instrument anywhere in the exam.** Account for search cost and the
   handover item becomes the measurement 1.11 describes; without it, it is an
   accuracy test of a prediction that is not about accuracy.
3. **`EXPECTED` is not covered by the rubric digest.** The digest hashes
   `grading/rubrics_*.py`; the calibration bands live in `calibration.py`, so a
   quiet widening there would not surface as a mismatch. One band was already
   widened once (D-EX-010, recorded). Extending the digest is the real fix and is
   not done.
4. **`cart_region` in the verdict certificate checker is sound but incomplete** —
   it takes the undirected closure of a relation that is directed once an action
   is forbidden, so it over-approximates reachability. It can never certify a
   false theorem, but it will refuse a certificate for a level separated only in
   the directed graph. Same shape as `lp_potential`'s standing caveat.
5. **`win_tighten` is exercised only at its no-op boundary.** An A2-family level
   has one binary victory test, so a real threshold would be unsolvable for a
   reason none of the three certificate kinds can state. It is on the paper as a
   control, not as a live operator.
6. **The class (ii) state-space bound assumes comb-shaped geometry.** It is not a
   general-purpose bound and is applied only to the levels it fits.
7. **One examinee per handover tier.** n=1 per tier. Nothing here supports a
   variance claim about fresh readers.
8. **The four papers were built by four separate agents.** Their conventions
   converged because the interface forced them to, not because one mind wrote
   them; the rubric weights across types are not calibrated against each other
   and no cross-type total should be quoted.

## Not attempted

* No live game, no dev-pile game, no API call, no model call from any code path
  in `exam/`. The fresh readers and the cheaters are subagents the *session*
  spawned, never something the exam invokes.
* No Phase 4 sealed-pile question. That is the point of the sequencing: the
  procedure is frozen now so that the only new work later is the per-game
  justification.
9. **The handover `name_class` items are answerable without the manual.** Their
   definitions classify rather than identify, so a cheater scored 11/12 against
   a 7/12 baseline reading syntax alone. The fix is to make each definition a
   pointer ("the name as used in the laws section") rather than a description —
   but five of the twelve names are exam-invented and appear nowhere in the
   manual verbatim, so a pure pointer does not exist for them. Left unfixed and
   documented rather than patched late: the fresh readers sat this sheet, and
   changing it after the fact would invalidate the only handover data there is.
10. **`points` is still on the sheet.** The leak was fixed by making the values
   uniform, not by removing the field. Any future paper that weights items by
   anything correlated with the answer reintroduces it; the new metadata check
   is what stands between that and a shipped leak.
11. **Two cheater agents, four sheets, one pass.** No adversarial reader has
   seen the fixed sheets. The leaks that remain are the ones nobody has looked
   for yet.
